Contribution of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter NKCC1 to Cl- secretion in rat OMCD.
In rat kidney the "secretory" isoform of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) localizes to the basolateral membrane of the alpha-intercalated cell. The purpose of this study was to determine whether rat outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) secretes Cl- and whether transepithelial Cl- transport occurs, in part, through Cl- uptake across the basolateral membrane mediated by NKCC1 in series with Cl- efflux across the apical membrane. OMCD tubules from rats treated with deoxycorticosterone pivalate were perfused in vitro in symmetrical HCO/CO2-buffered solutions. Cl- secretion was observed in this segment, accompanied by a lumen positive transepithelial potential. Bumetanide (100 microM), when added to the bath, reduced Cl- secretion by 78%, although the lumen positive transepithelial potential and fluid flux were unchanged. Bumetanide-sensitive Cl- secretion was dependent on extracellular Na+ and either K+ or NH, consistent with the ion dependency of NKCC1-mediated Cl- transport. In conclusion, OMCD tubules from deoxycorticosterone pivalate-treated rats secrete Cl- into the luminal fluid through NKCC1-mediated Cl- uptake across the basolateral membrane in series with Cl- efflux across the apical membrane. The physiological role of NKCC1-mediated Cl- uptake remains to be determined. However, the role of NKCC1 in the process of fluid secretion could not be demonstrated.
