Influence of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) exon 8 genotype on efficacy of tiapride and clinical outcome of alcohol withdrawal.
We tested the hypothesis that allelic variants of the human dopamine D2 receptor E8 genotype are associated with (i) dopamine D2 antagonist tiapride dose in treatment of alcohol withdrawal (n = 50) and (ii) with anxiety and depression in patients during alcoholism detoxification therapy (admission n = 87; discharge n = 50). DRD2 E8 A/A genotype was associated with increased dose of tiapride during a 9-day detoxification therapy and with increased anxiety and depression scores on admission and 2 weeks later. The findings suggest a pharmacogenetic influence of DRD2 E8 genotype on tiapride efficacy in alcohol withdrawal. In an earlier report, DRD2 E8 A/A genotype was associated with reduced responsiveness to the dopamine D2 agonist apomorphine; however, it is not clear whether both findings share the same biological basis. Earlier findings concerning association of DRD2 E8 A/A with increased anxiety and depression are replicated for the first time.
