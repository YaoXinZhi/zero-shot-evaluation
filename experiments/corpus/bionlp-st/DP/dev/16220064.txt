A review of the structural and functional features of olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin receptor blocker.
The angiotensin II (A-II) type 1 (AT1) receptor-mediated effects of A-II play a key role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Effective inhibition of A-II is provided by the latest class of antihypertensive medications, the AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs). These orally available agents were developed around a common imidazole-based structural core. The most recent member of this drug class to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, olmesartan medoxomil, contains unique features that may explain its clinical efficacy. Key structural elements of olmesartan medoxomil include a hydroxyalkyl substituent at the imidazole 4-position and a hydrolyzable ester group at the imidazole 5-position. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving these groups may contribute to the potentiation of antagonist activity. After oral administration, olmesartan medoxomil is deesterified in the intestinal tract to produce the active metabolite olmesartan, which undergoes no additional metabolic change. The marked antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil may result from a unique pharmacological interaction of the drug with the AT1 receptor, resulting in a potent, long-lasting, dose-dependent blockade of A-II. This review article characterizes the structural features of olmesartan that may be responsible for its clinical efficacy. Inferential pharmacological studies compare and contrast the effects of olmesartan to those of other ARBs in comparable preclinical animal models.
