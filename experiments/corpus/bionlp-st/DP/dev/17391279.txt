In vivo effects of amtolmetin guacyl on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defence systems. Comparison with non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs.
1. The in vivo effects of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) amtolmetin guacyl, a pro-drug of the NSAID tolmetin, on lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) in rat gastric mucosa, colon mucosa and liver, were compared with the effects of non-selective (indomethacin, diclofenac) and COX-2 selective (celecoxib) NSAIDs. 2. Indomethacin treatment led to an increase in lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and to a decrease in catalase activity and glutathione levels in gastric mucosa. In contrast, amtolmetin guacyl treatment was without effects in gastric and colon mucosa, or liver from control animals. Like amtolmetin guacyl, celecoxib had no effect on the lipid peroxidation, or on enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant defence systems in gastric mucosa. 3. It is suggested that the lack of pro-oxidant effects in vivo associated with amtolmetin guacyl treatment contribute improved gastric tolerability.
