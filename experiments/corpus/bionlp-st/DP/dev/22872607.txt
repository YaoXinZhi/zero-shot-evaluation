AKRs expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes from smokers: The role of body mass index.
Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) metabolize a wide range of substrates, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), generating metabolites (o-quinones) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of initiating and promoting carcinogenesis. Exposure to PAHs, their metabolites, and ROS further increase AKRs isoform expression that may amplify oxidative damage. Human AKR enzymes are highly polymorphic, and allelic variants may contribute to different AKRs expression in individuals. Despite the importance of AKRs in PAHs metabolism, there are no studies that evaluate, in general human populations, the effect of PAHs on AKRs expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of tobacco smoke exposure, and AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 polymorphisms, on AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in PBLs from smokers. In the smoker group, there is a statistically significant positive association between AKR1A1, AKR1C1, and AKR1C3 mRNA induction and urine cotinine levels in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) less than 25. However, AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 alleles did not influence AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 mRNA levels. These results suggest that AKRs induction by PAHs in smokers' PBLs is associated with BMI; therefore, the role of adipose tissue accumulation in PAHs' effects needs further investigation.
