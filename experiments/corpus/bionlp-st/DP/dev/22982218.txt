The PARP inhibitor PJ34 modifies proliferation, NIS expression and epigenetic marks in thyroid cancer cell lines.
Since PARP-1 is supposed to be part of a multimeric repressor of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression, in this study the effect of the PARP inhibitor PJ34 on several properties of thyroid cancer cell lines was investigated. In TPC1, BCPAP, FRO, WRO cell lines PJ34 induced a strong increase in NIS mRNA levels. In BCPAP and TPC1 cells also significant increase of radio-iodine uptake was induced. Accordingly, in transfection experiments performed in TPC1 cells, treatment with PJ34 increased NIS promoter activity without affecting PARP-1 binding to the promoter sequence. We also investigated the epigenetic status of NIS promoter after PJ34 treatment in TPC1 cell line: in addition to an increase of histone modification activation marks (H3K9K14ac, H3K4me3), surprisingly we observed also an increase of H3K27me3, a classical repressive mark. Our data demonstrate that in various thyroid cancer cell lines PARP inhibition increases NIS gene expression through a particular modulation of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we suggest that PARP inhibitors may deserve future investigations as tools for medical treatment of thyroid cancer.
