Reduced in vitro and in vivo toxicity of siRNA-lipoplexes with addition of polyglutamate.
We previously designed a new siRNA vector that efficiently silences genes in vitro and in vivo. The vector originality is based on the fact that, in addition to the siRNA molecule, it contains two components: 1) a cationic liposome that auto-associates with the siRNA to form particles called "lipoplexes" and, 2) an anionic polymer which enhances the lipoplex's efficiency. This anionic polymer can be a nucleic acid, a polypeptide or a polysaccharide. We show here how the nature of the added anionic polymer into our siRNA delivery system impacts the toxic effects induced by siRNA lipoplexes. We first observed that: (i) siRNA lipoplexes-induced toxicity was cell line dependent, tumoral cell lines being the more sensitive; and (ii) plasmid DNA-containing siRNA lipoplexes were more toxic than polyglutamate-containing ones or cationic liposomes. We next determined that the toxicity induced by plasmid-containing lipoplexes is a long-lasting effect that decreased cell survival capacity for several generations. We also found that treated cells underwent death following apoptosis pathway. Systemic injection to mice of siRNA lipoplexes, rather than of cationic liposome, triggered a production of several cytokines in mice and replacement of plasmid by polyglutamate reduced the elevation of all assayed cytokines. In order to enhance siRNA lipoplexes efficiency, the addition of polyglutamate as anionic polymer should be preferred to plasmid DNA as far as in vitro as well as in vivo toxicity is concerned.
