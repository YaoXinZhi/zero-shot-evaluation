Design, synthesis, characterization and anti-inflammatory evaluation of novel pyrazole amalgamated flavones.
A series of novel pyrazole amalgamated flavones has been designed and synthesized from 1-methyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxy-phenyl)-1H-pyrazole 6. The structures of regioisomers 6 and 7 were resolved by 2D (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HSQC and (1)H-(13)C HMBC experiments. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their in vitro COX inhibition and in vivo carrageenan induced hind paw edema in rats and acetic acid induced vascular permeability in mice. Although the compounds have inhibitory profile against both COX-1 and COX-2, some of the compounds are found to be selective against COX-2, supported by inhibition of paw edema and vascular permeability. Docking studies were also carried out to determine the structural features which sway the anti-inflammatory activity of the tested compounds. The keto and phenolic -OH are major factors that are prominently involved in interaction with COX-2 active site.
