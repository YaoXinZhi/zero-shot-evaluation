Charge screening between anionic and cationic surfactants in ionic liquids.
The aggregation and interfacial behavior of mixtures of anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate, SDS) and cationic (dodecylammonium bromide, DTAB) surfactants were investigated. A room-temperature ionic liquid (IL) was explored as a solvent for the SDS/DTAB system and compared to water. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) and composition in mixed micelles were determined for both solvents. Our experiments showed nearly ideal mixing of SDS/DTAB over the entire composition range and suggest that charge screening is prominent in ILs. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the strong electrostatic attraction and a multiphase composition gap in water. Two models by Clint and Rubingh, which describe ideal and nonideal micellar behavior, respectively, are discussed on the basis of our results. According to Rubingh's model, the composition of mixed micelles is gradually changing with the bulk composition in ILs but tends to be a 1:1 ratio in water. The results here are further support of the strong charge screening in ionic liquids.
