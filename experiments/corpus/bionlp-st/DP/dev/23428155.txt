Solubility-driven optimization of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones leading to a promising antibacterial agent.
The solubility-driven structural modification of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones is described, which resulted in the development of a new series of benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinone analogues with high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including that against linezolid-resistant strains and low hERG inhibition. With regard to structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends among the various substituents on the pyridyl ring, relatively small and nonbasic substituents were preferable to sterically demanding or basic substituents. Oxazolidinone ring substitution on the pyridyl ring generated analogues with antibacterial activity superior to imidazolidinone ring. Solubility was enhanced by the incorporation of polar groups, especially when compounds were converted to their prodrugs. Among the prodrugs, compound 85 exhibited excellent solubility and a good pharmacokinetic profile. In a MRSA systemic infection model, compound 85 displayed an ED50 = 5.00 mg/kg, a potency that is 2-fold better than that of linezolid.
