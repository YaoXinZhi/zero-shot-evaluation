Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of pyripyropene A derivatives as potent and selective acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) inhibitors: Part 2.
Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 7-O-p-cyanobenzoyl pyripyropene A derivatives with modification at C1 and 11 are described. Regioselective mono-deprotection of di-tert-butylsilylene acetal was critical in their synthesis.
