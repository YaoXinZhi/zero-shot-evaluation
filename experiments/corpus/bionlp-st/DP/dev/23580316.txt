Anti-Ulcerative Colitis Activity of Compounds from Euphorbia granuleta Forssk.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-ulcerative colitis (UC) activity of the total alcohol extracts of Euphorbia granuleta Forssk. (Euphorpiaceae), isolate and identify the active compounds that could be responsible for the activity, in addition to determination of the possible mechanism of action. Six compounds were isolated and identified from this plant: three phenolic compounds (kampferol, kampferol-3-glucoside and kampferol-3-galactoside) in addition to three steroidal compounds (1-ethoxypentacosane, heptacosan-1-ol and β-sitosterol). Three compounds (heptacosan-1-ol, β-sitosterol and kampferol-3-galactoside) were found to be responsible for the anti-UC activity of E. granuleta extract. The anti-UC activity of these compounds may be explained by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in addition to reduction of colonic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. No side effects were reported on liver and kidney functions. The active compounds reduced both serum TNF-α and mucosal MDA levels. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
