Murine chromosomal location of the mu and kappa opioid receptor genes.
Opioid receptors are the membrane proteins that mediate the pain-relieving effect of opioid drugs, such as morphine and fentanyl as well as endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins and endorphins. Using cDNAs for the mu and the kappa opioid receptors, we mapped the chromosomal locations of their genes in mouse. Multilocus cross analysis located the mu receptor gene Oprm on Chr 10 and the kappa receptor gene Oprk1 on Chr 1. Both genes are near centromere, with no markers more centromeric. These data indicate that the two opioid receptors are different gene products, ruling out the possibility that they may be differential splicing products from the same gene.
