Folding pathway of guanidine-denatured disulfide-intact wild-type and mutant bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A.
The refolding kinetics of guanidine-denatured disulfide-intact bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and its proline-42-to-alanine mutant (Pro42Ala) have been studied by monitoring tyrosine burial and 2'-cytidine monophosphate (2'CMP) inhibitor binding. The folding rate for wild-type RNase A is faster in the presence of the inhibitor 2'CMP than in its absence, indicating that the transition-state structure in the rate-determining step is stabilized by 2'CMP. The folding rate monitored by 2'CMP binding to the major slow-folding species of Pro42Ala RNase A is faster than the folding rate monitored by tyrosine burial; however, the folding rate monitored by inhibitor binding to the minor slow-folding species is decreased significantly over the folding rate monitored by tyrosine burial, indicating that the major and minor slow-folding species of Pro42Ala fold to the native state with different transition-state conformations in the rate-determining step.
