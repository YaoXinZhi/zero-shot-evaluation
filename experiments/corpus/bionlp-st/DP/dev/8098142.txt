Histamine enhances the depolarizing afterpotential of immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus via H1-receptor activation.
Previous studies have demonstrated that histamine primarily excites unidentified neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus. We investigated the neuromodulatory effects of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus using intracellular recording techniques from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explant. Exogenous application of histamine (0.1-100 microM) to vasopressinergic neurons produced a small membrane depolarization accompanied by an increase of up to 100% in the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential that follows current-evoked trains of action potentials. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine did not depend upon the depolarization. Further, histamine enhanced the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential when blocking the afterhyperpolarizing potential with d-tubocurarine or apamin, and in the presence of tetrodotoxin and d-tubocurarine or apamin, indicating a postsynaptic action of histamine on the depolarizing afterpotential that is not simply a reflection of a decrease in the afterhyperpolarizing potential. These toxins also had no effect on the histamine-induced depolarization. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine was mimicked by the histamine H1-receptor agonist 2-thiazolylethylamine and was reduced or blocked by the H1-receptor antagonist promethazine, but was not blocked or reduced in the presence of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine. In summary, these results show that the excitatory effect of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus is due in part to the H1-receptor-mediated enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential independent of any change in the afterhyperpolarizing potential or membrane potential.
