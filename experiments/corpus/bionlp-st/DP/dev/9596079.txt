Peripheral blood mononuclear cells express mutated NCCT mRNA in Gitelman's syndrome: evidence for abnormal thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransport.
Genetic analysis has demonstrated complete linkage between the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene (NCCT or TSC) and Gitelman's syndrome (GS). Several genomic NCCT mutations have been reported. This study was performed to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) express NCCT mRNA and whether defective PBMC NaCl cotransport could be demonstrated in GS. PBMC were isolated from two brothers with GS, their parents, and healthy control subjects. Northern analysis revealed that NCCT mRNA is expressed in PBMC. The sequence of full-length NCCT cDNA amplified from normal PBMC was identical to human renal NCCT cDNA. Two different mutations were detected in the patients' NCCT cDNA (compound heterozygote). In cDNA derived from the patient's maternal allele, exon 24 was deleted, resulting in a premature stop codon (after amino acid 920). cDNA derived from the patient's paternal allele had an additional 119-bp insertion between exons 3 and 4, generating a premature stop codon (after amino acid 187). The patient's genomic DNA had a previously described 5' splice site mutation in intron 24, GGT --> GTT (maternal allele), and a new 3' splice site mutation in intron 3, CAG --> CAA (paternal allele), which resulted in the activation of a nearby cryptic splice site in intron 3. The latter mutation was not present in 300 normal chromosomes. To determine the functional significance of these findings, chlorothiazide-inhibitable 22Na uptake was measured in PBMC from control subjects, the parents, and the patients with GS in the presence of bumetanide. In control PBMC, chlorothiazide inhibited 22Na uptake by approximately 9%. PBMC from the two patients with GS failed to respond to chlorothiazide. These results demonstrate that PBMC can be used for mutational analysis of NCCT mRNA in patients with GS. Furthermore, functional evidence is provided that the underlying cause of GS is defective NCCT NaCl cotransport.
