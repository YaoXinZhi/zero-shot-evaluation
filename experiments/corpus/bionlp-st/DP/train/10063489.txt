Effects of mCPP on the extracellular concentrations of serotonin and dopamine in rat brain.
Intravenous administration of m-chloro-phenylpiperazine (mCPP) (0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg) induced a marked and dose-related increase in extracellular concentrations of serotonin in hippocampus (300-1,400% of baseline) as measured using in vivo microdialysis in awake male Wistar rats of the spontaneously hypertensive (SH) strain. Indicating that the effect of mCPP was caused by a reversal of the serotonin transporter, it was antagonized by pretreatment with the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram (10 mg/kg) but was unaffected by local administration of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 microns). mCPP was also shown to induce an increase in extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum of SH rats and in the nucleus accumbens of rats of the Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain; this effect of mCPP was, however, much weaker (125-170% of baseline) than the effect on serotonin; moreover, it seems to be TTX-sensitive. In anesthetized SD rats, mCPP induced a moderate reduction of nigral dopamine cell firing rate; supporting the assumption that this effect is secondary to the observed increase in dopamine release, it was blocked by pretreatment either with the dopamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine or with the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol. In conclusion, the results suggest that mCPP induces a marked, TTX-insensitive increase in serotonin release in rat brain, but only a modest and TTX-sensitive increase in the extracellular levels of dopamine.
