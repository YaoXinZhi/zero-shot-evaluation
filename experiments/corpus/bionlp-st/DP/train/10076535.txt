Androgen antagonistic effect of estramustine phosphate (EMP) metabolites on wild-type and mutated androgen receptor.
Estramustine phosphate is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine phosphate is metabolically activated in vivo, and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol inhibit the assembly of microtubules [for review see: Kreis W, In: Concepts, Mechanisms, and New Targets for Chemotherapy (Ed. Muggia FM), pp. 163-184. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1995]. We investigated, by displacement of [3H]methyltrienolone in the presence of 2.5 mM of triamcinolone acetonide, the binding of estramustine phosphate and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol, as well as other antiandrogen agents including alpha-estradiol, bicalutamide, and hydroxyflutamide, to the mutated androgen receptor (m-AR) in LNCaP cells and to the wild-type androgen receptor in wild-type AR cDNA expression plasmid (w-pAR0) cDNA-transfected HeLa cells. Analogous to the antiandrogens, bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, binding of estramustine phosphate metabolites to the androgen receptor was observed. The EC50 values (in microM) were: estramustine phosphate, > 10; estramustine, 3.129 +/- 0.312; estromustine; 2.612 +/- 0.584; estrone, 0.800 +/- 0.090; alpha-estradiol, 1.051 +/- 0.096; beta-estradiol, 0.523 +/- 0.028; bicalutamide, 4.920 +/- 0.361; and hydroxyflutamide, 0.254 +/- 0.012. The transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to bicalutamide, estramustine could not induce luciferase activity in either w-pAR0 or m-pARL transfected HeLa cells. In contrast, a strong induction of the reporter activity by dihydrotestosterone was observed. Down-regulation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, an AR-target gene, by estramustine and bicalutamide was accompanied by the blockade of the mutated androgen receptor. Exposure of LNCaP cells to estramustine for 24 hr caused transcriptional inhibition of PSA in a concentration-dependent manner. The levels of PSA mRNA decreased 56 and 90% when LNCaP cells were treated with 5 and 10 microM of estramustine, respectively (IC50 = 10.97 +/- 1.68 microM). Binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-AR in LNCaP cells resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of PSA expression, suggesting that hydroxyflutamide acted as an agonist of the m-AR. Our data indicate that estramustine phosphate metabolites perform as androgen antagonists of AR, an additional mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of estramustine phosphate in patients with prostate cancer.
