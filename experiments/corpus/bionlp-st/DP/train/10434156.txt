[Psychopharmacological profile of venlafaxine].
Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which blocks reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. These data have been confirmed by behavioral tests. It has been shown that by decreasing the overall cerebral quantity of 5-HT and NA, venlafaxine continued to have an antidepressant action in animal models. In addition, the drug has been shown to act preferentially on 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
