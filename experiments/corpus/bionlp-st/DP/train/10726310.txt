[Plasminogen binding with decapeptide and polypeptide fragments of streptokinase].
The plasminogen binding with streptokinase decapeptides, modeling the primary structure of molecule, and chymotryptic fragments of streptokinase have been investigated. The immunoenzymatic assay has shown that plasminogen binds to all streptokinase fragments with the decreasing affinity in the set of fragments: 36 > 30 > 17 > 7 > 11 kDa. Location of the binding sites in streptokinase primary structure was performed using the immobilized decapeptides on plastic pins adopted to IEA. In the presence of 10 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid 11 sites for human Glu- and mini-plasminogens, pig and bovine plasminogens binding have been found. They were of the same location for human, bovine and pig plasminogens. 3 sites were located in plasminogen alpha-domain--T43-A72, N113-T126, Q133-V158, 5 sites in beta-domain--T163-L188, A203-S222, Q239-I264, Y275-L294, T315-L340, and 3 sites in gamma-domain--T361-R362, N377-E392, T397-N410. Participation of linear part of streptokinase polypeptide chain in plasminogen--streptokinase complex formation is suggested.
