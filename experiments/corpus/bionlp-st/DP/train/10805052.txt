Comparison of the AT1-receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, and the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, in fixed combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients.
AIM: To compare candesartan cilexetil and lisinopril in fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide with respect to antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: This was a double-blind (double-dummy), randomised, parallel group comparison in patients with a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mm Hg on prior antihypertensive monotherapy. Treatments were candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide 8/12.5 mg once daily (n = 237) and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg once daily (n = 116) for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change in trough sitting diastolic blood pressure. RESULTS: Changes in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups (mean difference 0.5 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval -1.6, 2.7, P = 0.20). No significant differences between the groups was found for other haemodynamic variables (sitting systolic blood pressure, standing blood pressure, sitting/erect heart rate, and proportion of responders and controlled patients). Both drugs were well tolerated but the proportion of patients with at least one adverse event was significantly greater in the lisinopril group (80% vs 69%, P = 0.020). The proportion of patients spontaneously reporting cough (23.1% vs 4.6%) and discontinuing therapy due to adverse events (12.0% vs 5.9%) was also higher in the lisinopril group compared with the candesartan cilexetil group. CONCLUSIONS: The fixed combinations of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 8/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg once daily are equally effective as antihypertensive agents. The fixed combination containing candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than that containing lisinopril.
