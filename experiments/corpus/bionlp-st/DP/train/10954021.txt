Accumulation of cystathionine, cystathionine ketimine, and perhydro-1,4-thiazepine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in whole brain and various regions of the brain of D, L-propargylglycine-treated rats.
Experimental cystathioninuria was induced in rats by administration of the cystathionine gamma-lyase inhibitor, D,L-propargylglycine. The cystathionine metabolites, cystathionine ketimine (CK) and perhydro-1,4-thiazepine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (PHTZDC), were identified in whole brain and various regions of the brain in D,L-propargylglycine-treated rats. The concentration of CK and PHTZDC in whole brain and various regions of the brain increased gradually after administration of D,L-propargylglycine, and reached the highest value at about 20 hours. CK and PHTZDC accumulated in whole brain and various regions of the brain in proportion to the amount of accumulated cystathionine after D,L-propargylglycine administration. The concentration of these compounds in the cerebellum was higher versus the other regions of the rat brain.
