A gene for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy maps to chromosome 5q31.
Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized seizures in the first hours of life and responding only to pyridoxine hydrochloride. The pathogenesis of PDE is unknown, but an alteration in the binding of pyridoxal 5-phosphate to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been postulated in patients with PDE. Results are reported for genetic linkage analyses in four families with consanguineous parents and in one family with nonconsanguineous parents. The GAD1 (2q31) and GAD2 genes (10p23) were tested and excluded. A genomewide search was subsequently performed, using microsatellite markers at an average distance of 10 cM, and the search revealed linkage of the disease-causing gene to markers on chromosome 5q31.2-q31.3 (maximum LOD score [Z(max)] 8.43 at recombination fraction [theta] 0 and Zmax=7.58 at straight theta=0 at loci D5S2017 and D5S1972, respectively). A recombination event, between loci D5S638 and D5S463, in one family defined the distal boundary, and a second recombination event between loci D5S2011 and D5S2017 in another family defined the proximal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the PDE gene (5.1 cM). Ongoing studies may lead to the identification of the disease-causing gene.
