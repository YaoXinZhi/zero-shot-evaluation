Pharmacokinetic analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of intravenous nordihydroguaiaretic acid in the mouse.
Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) has been shown to inhibit both 5-lipoxygenase and ornithine decarboxylase and is active against several cancer cell lines and at least one mouse tumor model. Despite these findings, there have been no reports on the pharmacokinetics of NDGA. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to detect NDGA in mouse plasma. The limit of detection of this method was 0.5 microg/ml. Administration of NDGA (50 mg/kg, i.v.) to mice resulted in a peak plasma concentration of 14.7 microg/ml. The terminal half-life of NDGA was 135.0 min with a clearance of 201.9 ml/min x kg.
