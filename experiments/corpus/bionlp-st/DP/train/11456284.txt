Clinical, biochemical and molecular genetic data in five children with Gitelman's syndrome.
Gitelman's variant of Bartter's syndrome, inherited hypokalemic alkalosis, is caused by mutation in the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter (NCCT). The main clinical symptoms are: muscular weakness, carpopedal spasm, constipation and short stature. The diagnosis was suspected in five children according to clinical criteria. All patients exhibited carpopedal spasm during febrile illness, three patients had short stature. Biochemical features were: metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, low IGF-I levels, hyperkaliuria, hypernatriuria, hypocalciuria and normoprostaglandinuria. Three patients had elevated plasma renin activity and hyperaldosteronism. Mutational analysis of the NCCT gene confirmed the diagnosis in all five patients. Different forms of therapy, potassium and magnesium substitution, spironolactone and indomethacin failed to fully correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but markedly improved growth velocity and normalized IGF-I levels in the three patients with short stature. During therapy, clinical symptoms disappeared. We conclude that Gitelman's syndrome is a disorder with a variable symptom profile, but can be suspected on clinical signs already in early childhood. The early diagnosis is essential in preventing complications.
