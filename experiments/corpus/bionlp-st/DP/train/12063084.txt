The antipsychotic aripiprazole is a potent, partial agonist at the human 5-HT1A receptor.
Aripiprazole, 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinon e, a novel antipsychotic with partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptors, bound with high affinity to recombinant human 5-HT(1A) receptors (h5-HT(1A)) in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes and displayed potent, partial agonism at 5-HT(1A) receptors in a guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate ([(35)S]GTP gamma S)-binding assay that was blocked completely by a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. An interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors may contribute to the overall efficacy of aripiprazole against symptoms of schizophrenia, including anxiety, depression, cognitive and negative symptoms, and to its favorable side-effect profile. Combined with previous studies demonstrating the potent partial agonism of aripiprazole at dopamine D2 receptors, this study suggests aripiprazole is the first dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer.
