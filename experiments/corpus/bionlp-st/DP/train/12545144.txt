Effects of age and sex on the disposition of retigabine.
BACKGROUND: The novel antiepileptic drug retigabine is the first selective M-current potassium channel opener for KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 channels. Retigabine undergoes phase II metabolism (N-glucuronidation, acetylation) exclusively and renal excretion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of age and sex on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. METHODS: Healthy young (age range, 18-40 years) and elderly (age range, 66-81 years) white subjects (12 men and 12 women in each group) received a single 200-mg oral dose of retigabine. After dosing, blood was collected over a 72-hour period to determine plasma concentrations of retigabine and its acetylated metabolite, AWD21-360. Pharmacokinetics was compared for age group and sex by ANOVA. RESULTS: In young men, retigabine was rapidly absorbed, with the maximum concentration occurring within 2 hours, and was eliminated with an apparent clearance of 0.67 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) and a mean terminal half-life of 8.5 hours. Subjects were similarly exposed to AWD21-360. Compared with young men, young women had higher retigabine maximum concentration (56%) and exposure (20%) but similar clearance (0.68 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)); these differences were related to differences in body weight. Although maximum concentration was similar in elderly subjects, retigabine elimination was slower (30% lower apparent clearance normalized for weight), resulting in higher exposure (42%) and a longer half-life (30%). Because phase II metabolism is scarcely affected by age, these differences may be related to the known decline of renal function with age. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no substantial sex-related differences in the disposition of retigabine, a relevant decrease in clearance resulting in higher exposure occurs in elderly patients. The results suggest that decline of renal function with age may account for some of the observed changes.
