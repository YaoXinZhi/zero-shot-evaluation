L-methionine availability regulates expression of the methionine adenosyltransferase 2A gene in human hepatocarcinoma cells: role of S-adenosylmethionine.
In mammals, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis, is encoded by two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A. In liver, MAT1A expression is associated with high AdoMet levels and a differentiated phenotype, whereas MAT2A expression is associated with lower AdoMet levels and a dedifferentiated phenotype. In the current study, we examined regulation of MAT2A gene expression by l-methionine availability using HepG2 cells. In l-methionine-deficient cells, MAT2A gene expression is rapidly induced, and methionine adenosyltransferase activity is increased. Restoration of l-methionine rapidly down-regulates MAT2A mRNA levels; for this effect, l-methionine needs to be converted into AdoMet. This novel action of AdoMet is not mediated through a methyl transfer reaction. MAT2A gene expression was also regulated by 5'-methylthioadenosine, but this was dependent on 5'-methylthioadenosine conversion to methionine through the salvage pathway. The transcription rate of the MAT2A gene remained unchanged during l-methionine starvation; however, its mRNA half-life was significantly increased (from 100 min to more than 3 h). The effect of l-methionine withdrawal on MAT2A mRNA stabilization requires both gene transcription and protein synthesis. We conclude that MAT2A gene expression is modulated as an adaptive response of the cell to l-methionine availability through its conversion to AdoMet.
