Further characterization of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) regulatory activity, I: Effect on opioid- and alpha 2-mediated supraspinal antinociception in mice.
Picomol doses of the acetylated derivative of beta-endorphin-(1-31), injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) in mice, reduced the analgesic activity of morphine, etorphine and beta-endorphin-(1-31), while the efficiency of DAGO and DADLE in producing analgesia was enhanced. The effects of the delta agonists DPDPE and [D-Ala2]-Deltorphin II were not altered by this treatment. After alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) injection, morphine antagonized the analgesia of DAGO. The regulatory effect of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) was exhibited when giving the peptide both before (up to 24 h) and after the opioids. Naloxone did not prevent or reverse that modulatory activity; moreover, pretreatment with the acetylated peptide did not change the pA2 value displayed by the antagonist at the mu receptor. The antinociceptive activity of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was also increased in mice treated with alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31). The reducing activity of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) upon morphine- and beta-endorphin-induced analgesia was not exhibited in mice undergoing treatment with pertussis toxin or N-ethylmaleimide, agents known to impair the function of Gi/Go transducer proteins. However, the enhancing activity displayed by this peptide upon DAGO- DADLE and clonidine-evoked antinociception was still manifested. These results confirm and strengthen the idea of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) acting as a non-competitive regulator of mu opioid- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated supraspinal antinociception. A neural substrate acted on by both receptors (likely Gi/Go transducer proteins) appears to be involved in the effects of that neuropeptide.
