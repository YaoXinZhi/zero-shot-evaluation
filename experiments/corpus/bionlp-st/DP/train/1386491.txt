Effectiveness of endopeptidase inhibition (candoxatril) in congestive heart failure.
Candoxatril is a novel, orally active inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11, the enzyme that degrades atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The acute and chronic (10 days treatment) hemodynamic and hormonal effects of candoxatril (150 mg twice daily) in 12 patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. On study day 1, candoxatril acutely increased plasma ANP levels, suppressed aldosterone and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. After 10 days of treatment, basal ANP was increased and basal aldosterone was decreased. Body weight was reduced, most likely reflecting chronic natriuretic or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward increased cardiac index and reduced preload values. On study day 10, the acute effects of candoxatril were similar to those on day 1 (i.e., ANP was further increased, aldosterone was suppressed, and right and left ventricular filling pressures were decreased). Thus, candoxatril may offer a new and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of heart failure.
