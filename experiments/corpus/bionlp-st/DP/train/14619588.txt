[The effects of nandrolone phenylpropionate on androgen receptor of liver and sexual glands in burned rats].
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of nandrolone phenylpropionate (NP) on androgen receptor (AR) of liver and sexual glands in burned rats for supporting the clinical application of anabolic steroids. METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats with a deep second-degree cutaneous burn of 20% total body surface area were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 5 mg/kg NP (NP group) or normal saline as placebo (control group) every other day. The mean integrated optical density (mIOD) of androgen receptor (AR) in liver, testis, ovary tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry ENVISION and LSAB respectively on the 4th, 7th, 14th and 21st days after scalding. RESULTS: The density of AR in liver tissue in NP group was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The density of AR in testis and ovary tissues showed no significant difference between NP group and control group at every time-point (P > 0.05). The side-effect of NP at this dose level on sexual glands seemed limited. CONCLUSION: Nandrolone phenylpropionate up-regulated the density of AR in liver tissue, whereas it had no significant effects on the density of AR in testis and ovary tissues. NP was used with safety at this dose level in rats.
