Regulation of prostate-specific antigen by activin A in prostate cancer LNCaP cells.
Activins are multifunctional growth and differentiation factors and stimulate FSH-beta gene expression and FSH secretion by the pituitary gonadotropes. Follistatins bind activin, resulting in the neutralization of activin bioactivity. The activin/follistatin system is present in the prostate tissue. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in male reproductive physiology as well as being very important as a tumor marker for prostate cancer. Thus the regulation of PSA has important clinical implications. Previous studies showed that PSA is primarily regulated by androgens. In the present study, we evaluated the direct effects of activin A on the proliferation and PSA production of prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which express functional activin receptors and androgen receptor and PSA. LNCaP cells were treated with activin A and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with or without their antagonists (follistatin or the nonsteroidal anti-androgen bicalutamide). Activin A decreased cell growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DHT increased it in a biphasic manner. In contrast to their opposing actions on cell growth, both activin A and DHT upregulated PSA gene expression and increased PSA secretion by LNCaP cells. The effects of activin A and DHT to increase PSA production were synergistic or additive. Follistatin or bicalutamide was without effect on cell growth or PSA production. The effects of activin A on LNCaP cells were blocked by follistatin, not by bicalutamide, whereas effects of DHT were prevented by bicalutamide, not by follistatin. Activin A upregulates PSA production, and the effect is through an androgen receptor-independent pathway. The activin/follistatin system can be a physiological modulator of PSA gene transcription and secretion in the prostate tissue, and activins may cooperate with androgen to upregulate PSA in vivo.
