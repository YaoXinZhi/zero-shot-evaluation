Activation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons by carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker, in spontaneous hypertensive rats.
We performed a study in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) to determine whether carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, activates capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons (CSSNs), thereby promoting the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide with an important role in maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Carvedilol given intravenously at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg transiently decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and increased renal tissue blood flow with increases in CGRP levels in plasma and kidney. These effects induced by carvedilol were not seen in animals pretreated with capsazepine, an antagonist of capsaicin. Although 1.0 mg/kg cavedilol markedly decreased MABP, it neither increased renal tissue blood flow nor CGRP levels in plasma and kidney. Prazosin, a selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and bisoprolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, decreased MABP with capsazepine, showing no antagonistic action in either cases, and these agents increased neither renal tissue blood flow nor levels of CGRP in plasma and kidney. Both ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-but anol], a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and capsaicin mimicked effects induced by 0.3 mg/kg carvedilol. Administration of 1.0 mg/kg ICI 118,551 produced effects similar to those induced by 1.0 mg/kg carvedilol. These observations strongly suggested that the low dose of carvedilol might activate CSSNs in SHR to increase the release of CGRP, thereby decreasing blood pressure with an increase in renal tissue blood flow. The effects induced by carvedilol seemed to be mediated by its beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade activity.
