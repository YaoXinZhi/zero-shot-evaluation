Psychopharmacology of anticonvulsants: levetiracetam as a synaptic vesicle protein modulator.
ISSUE: A novel mechanism of action has recently been described for levetiracetam, a member of a new class of anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam binds selectively and with high affinity to a synaptic vesicle protein known as SV2A, thought to be involved with synaptic vesicle exocytosis and presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
