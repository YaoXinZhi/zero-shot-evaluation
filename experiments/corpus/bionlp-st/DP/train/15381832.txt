Secretion of gastric mucus phospholipids in response to beta-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor activation is mediated by SRC kinase-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation.
Recent advances in understanding the nature of cellular responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation indicate that integration of the converging regulatory signals into functional cellular pathways requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation. In this study, we report that G protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor activation leading to stimulation in gastric mucus phospholipid secretion occurs with the involvement of EGFR. Using [14C]choline-labeled gastric mucosal cells in culture, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, on phospholipid release was subject to a dose-dependent suppression by EGFR kinase inhibitor, PD153035, as well as wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. Both inhibitors, moreover, caused the reduction in the gastric mucosal cell phospholipid secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second messenger, cAMP as well as adenyl cyclase activator, forskolin. The gastric mucosal phospholipid secretory responses to isoproterenol, furthermore, were inhibited by PP2, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase Src responsible for ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation, but not by ERK inhibitor, PD98059. The inhibition of ERK, moreover, did not cause attenuation in phospholipid secretory responses to cAMP and forskolin. The findings underline the central role of EGFR in mediation of gastric mucosal secretory processes, and demonstrate the requirement for Src kinase-dependent EGFR transactivation in regulation of gastric mucosal phospholipid secretion in response to beta-adrenergic GPCR activation.
