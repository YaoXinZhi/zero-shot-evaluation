Differential effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on lipopolysaccharide-induced adhesion molecule expression on human monocytes.
The effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on the 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, B7.1, B7.2, CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on monocytes was examined. Prostaglandin E1 suppressed B7.1 and CD40 expression, but prostaglandin E2 did not effect on any type of adhesion molecule expression. Both prostaglandins inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production and T-cell proliferation of lipopolysaccharide-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Among prostaglandin E1 receptors (IP/EP1/EP2/EP3/EP4) agonists, ONO-1301, a prostanoid IP-receptor agonist, prevented B7.1 and CD40 expression. ONO-AE1-259-01 a prostanoid EP2-receptor agonist, ONO-AE1-329, a prostanoid EP4-receptor agonist, and ONO-1301 inhibited TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Moreover, anti-B7.1 and anti-CD40 Abs prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Therefore, the effect of prostaglandin E1 on TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation might depend on the inhibition of B7.1 and CD40 expression, but that of prostaglandin E2 might be independent of adhesion molecules expression. In conclusion, the mechanism responsible for the effect of prostaglandin E1 on lipopolysaccharide-induced responses is distinct from that of prostaglandin E2.
