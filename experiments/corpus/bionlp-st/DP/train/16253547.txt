Rat hepatic stellate cells become retinoid unresponsive during activation.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play an essential role in fibrogenesis. Many stimuli cause HSC to activate, lose their Vitamin A and produce collagen. It is unclear whether Vitamin A loss causes activation, potentiates it or is simply an event in the cascade of activation changes. We determine if exogenous retinoids prevent the activation of freshly isolated rat HSC activated by plating on plastic. We also determine if retinoids: (1) reverse HSC activation; (2) maintain/restore HSC intracellular retinoid levels; (3) maintain expression of HSC nuclear receptors for retinoic acid (RAR) in HSC that are becoming activated or are chronically activated. Markers of activation in freshly isolated HSC were decreased by either retinol or retinoic acid without increases in HSC retinoid concentration. mRNA levels for RAR-alpha, RAR-beta and RAR-gamma, the nuclear receptors for retinoic acid, decreased during activation of freshly isolated HSC even with retinoid supplementation. RAR-alpha, RAR-beta and RAR-gamma mRNA and RAR-beta protein was undetectable in chronically activated HSC and remained absent after retinoic acid supplementation. Activation markers in chronically activated HSC were only slightly decreased after retinoid exposure. We conclude that exposure of HSC to extracellular retinoids diminishes some markers of activation but does not prevent HSC activation.
