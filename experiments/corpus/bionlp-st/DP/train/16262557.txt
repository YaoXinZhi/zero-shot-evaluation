The unexpected side effects of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Conventional nonselective NSAIDs are classically associated with a risk of gastrointestinal disorders.

As examples, ketorolac, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen and indomethacin have increased COX-1 selectivity when compared with naproxen and ibuprofen.
