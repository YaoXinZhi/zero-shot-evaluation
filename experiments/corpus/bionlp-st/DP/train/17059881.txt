Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy by risperidone: implications for the timing and magnitude of clinical response.
The objective of the study is to investigate whether dopamine D2 receptor occupancy by risperidone and plasma levels over time can account for therapeutic efficacy and the latency period to response. Thirty-eight examinations with (123)I-IBZM single photon emission computed tomography were performed on 22 patients with schizophrenia, at diagnosis, 48 h after starting risperidone treatment and at a stable dose. Risperidone plasma levels were determined and psychopathologic evaluations (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) were carried out. No differences in the striatal/occipital (S/O) ratio or plasma levels were found between examinations at the 48-h time point and when a stable dose level had been established, so these parameters could not account for the latency period required for clinical response. D2 receptor occupancy at 48 h correlated positively with clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, if these results are confirmed, D2 receptor occupancy at the beginning of treatment with risperidone may be a predictor of subsequent clinical response.
