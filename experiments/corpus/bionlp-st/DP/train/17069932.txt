High-affinity GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in pig forebrain white matter: a quantitative study.
GABA receptor activation in central nervous white matter may be protective during white matter hypoxia in the adult, and it may modify axonal conduction, especially in the developing brain. GABA uptake is important for the shaping of the GABA signal, but quantitative data are lacking for GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in central nervous white matter. We report that high-affinity uptake of GABA in adult pig corpus callosum, fimbria, subcortical pyramidal tracts, and occipital white matter is approximately 20% of that in temporal cortex gray matter. Tiagabine (0.1 microM), an antiepileptic drug that specifically inhibits the GAT-1 GABA transporter inhibited GABA uptake 50% in temporal cortex and 60-68% in white structures. This finding indicates that GAT-1 is an important GABA transporter in white matter and suggests that white matter GABA uptake is inhibited during tiagabine therapy. GABA transaminase activity in white structures was approximately 20% of neocortical values. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity in white structures was only 4% of that in neocortex (7-12 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 200 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1)). Since white matter activity of citrate synthase of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was approximately 25% of neocortical values ( approximately 0.4 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 1.5 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1)), the low GAD activity suggests a slower metabolic turnover of GABA in white than in gray matter.
