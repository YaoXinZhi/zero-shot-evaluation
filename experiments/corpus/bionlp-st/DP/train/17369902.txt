Peroxide-eliminating oxidoreductases as biosensors of antioxidant components of medicinal plants.
A simple in vitro test system based on the use of peroxide-eliminating oxidoreductases (glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase) is described. The system allows detection of antioxidant properties of aqueous extracts from raw medicinal plants. The system was used for testing water extract of Baikalskii-6 tea. Antioxidant and, presumably, adaptogenic activity of this tea was detected. In addition to activation of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, the preparation inhibits erythrocyte catalase and therefore should not be used for detection of antioxidant activity in in vitro screening tests.
