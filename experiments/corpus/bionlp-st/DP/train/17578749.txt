Biochemical assessments of total antioxidant status in active and nonactive female adults with intellectual disability.
Long-term physical activity is known to increase the antioxidant defense (AOD) system, whereas sedentary lifestyle is associated with oxidative stress (OS). The underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The aim of this prospective, nonrandomized study was to evaluate and compare the relationship between long-term physical activity and inactivity and plasma antioxidant status in female adults with intellectual disability (ID) that were diagnosed after birth. A total of 21 adults with ID were examined. The following AOD was examined: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), vitamin E, and vitamin A. Inactive persons with ID had significantly lower SOD (p<0.05), CAT (p<0.05), and GPX (p<0.05). All plasma vitamin levels were significantly higher in physically active subjects (vitamin A: 1.42 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, vitamin E: 31.32 +/- 2.62 mmol/l) than in sedentary control subjects (vitamin A: 1.02 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, vitamin E: 18.88 +/- 2.23 mmol/l) p<0.01. These results suggest that regular physical activity is associated with preserved AODs in adults with ID. As opposed to a physically active lifestyle, an inactive results in low levels of antioxidants.
