Multiple protective effects of melatonin against maternal cholestasis-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the rat fetal liver-placenta-maternal liver trio.
Maternal cholestasis is usually a benign condition for the mother but induces profound placental damage and may be lethal for the fetus. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects in rat maternal and fetal livers as also the placenta of melatonin or silymarin against the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by maternal obstructive cholestasis during the last third of pregnancy (OCP). Melatonin or silymarin administration (i.e. 5 mg/100 g bw/day after ligation of the maternal common bile duct on day 14 of pregnancy) reduced OCP-induced lipid peroxidation, and prevented decreases in total glutathione levels. However, the protective effect on OCP-induced impairment in the GSH/GSSG ratio was mild in the placenta and fetal liver, while absent in maternal liver. Melatonin or silymarin also reduced OCP-induced signs of apoptosis (increased caspase-3 activity and Bax-alpha upregulation) in all the organs assayed. Moreover, melatonin (but not silymarin) upregulated several proteins involved in the cellular protection against the oxidative stress in rats with OCP. These included, biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and the sodium-dependent vitamin C transport proteins SVCT1 and SVCT2, whose expression levels were enhanced in maternal and fetal liver by melatonin treatment. In contrast, in placenta only biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and SVCT2 were upregulated. These results indicate that whereas the treatment of cholestatic pregnant rats with melatonin or silymarin affords a direct protective antioxidant activity, only melatonin has dual beneficial effects against OCP-induced oxidative challenge in that it stimulates the expression of some components of the endogenous cellular antioxidant defense.
