Multicenter trial of everolimus in pediatric renal transplant recipients: results at three year.
There are few prospective clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors (or proliferation signal inhibitors) combined with CNI inhibitors in de novo pediatric renal transplantation. Results reported here are from a multicenter, open-label study in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients (<or=16 yr), in which patients received everolimus with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one yr, then entered an extension study for a further two yr. Nineteen patients completed the one-yr study, of whom three discontinued study medication. Fifteen of the remaining 16 patients entered the extension study, eight of whom were aged <10 yr (Group 1) and seven were aged 10-16 yr (Group 2). Mean daily dose of everolimus during the first 36 months was 1.53 mg/m(2) BSA. Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients in Group 2 and in one patient in Group 1. Biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection was reported in four patients (two in each age group). Graft survival at one yr was 100%; one patient in Group 2 lost their graft subsequently during the extension. For patients entering the extension, patient survival at three yr was 100%. There were three cases of viral infection, including one case of cytomegalovirus infection. At three yr, mean total cholesterol was 5.5 +/- 0.8 mm/L (213 +/- 31 mg/dL) and four patients received statin therapy. Mean serum creatinine at 36 months was 96 +/- 36 microm/L (1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dL). This is the first long-term prospective study to demonstrate that a regimen of everolimus, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids provides good efficacy, tolerability, and safety in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients.
