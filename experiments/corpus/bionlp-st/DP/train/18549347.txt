An expert opinion on safinamide in Parkinson's disease.
BACKGROUND: Dopamine replacement therapies (levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, anticholinergics, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors) remain the cornerstones of therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the treatment options for PD symptoms, a cure remains elusive. An optimal treatment would be one that combined relief in both motor and nonmotor symptoms with neuroprotective properties. Safinamide is an investigational drug for PD currently in development as add-on therapy to both dopamine agonists and levodopa. Safinamide is a unique molecule with a novel mode of action, targeting both dopaminergic and glutaminergic systems, and potentially provides motor symptom control. Preliminary results from experimental models suggest potential neuroprotective effects. Studies on the potential effects on nonmotor symptoms are ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the available clinical safety and efficacy results of safinamide. METHODS: A search of the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed, no time limits) was performed on 14 December 2007. The full text of all citations was obtained for review. Furthermore, two abstracts on safinamide published as proceedings of a European conference were reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Safinamide is a promising investigational drug for PD with a novel mode of action. Early reports confirm the potential efficacy of safinamide in PD. Further studies on potential effects on cognition and neuroprotection are needed.
