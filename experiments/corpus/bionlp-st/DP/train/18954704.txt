Corticosteroids and human recombinant activated protein C for septic shock.
This article summarizes the current knowledge on the benefit/risk profile from the use of low-dose corticosteroids and activated protein C in treating septic shock. Physicians should consider using low-dose corticosteroids and drotrecogin alpha activated in the treatment of patients who have vasopressor-dependent septic shock with persistent signs of hypoperfusion, organ dysfunction, or hypotension. The optimal timing for initiating these treatments is from 6 to 24 hours from onset of shock. When patients are receiving these drugs, physicians should systematically screen for superinfection and serious bleeding events.
