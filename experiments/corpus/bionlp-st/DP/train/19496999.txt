Dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex by haloperidol, olanzapine and clozapine.
AIMS: Aberrant dopamine transmission in extrastriatal brain regions has been repeatedly illustrated among patients with schizophrenia. Differences between typical and second-generation antipsychotics in dopamine D(2) receptor modulation within various brain areas remain a topic for debate. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate dopamine D(2/3) receptor apparent binding potential (BP(app)) and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex among clozapine-, olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Dopamine D(2/3) binding was studied on single-photon emission computed tomography ligand [(123)I]epidepride in 13 schizophrenia patients treated with medication (two with haloperidol, four with olanzapine and seven with clozapine), six drug-naive patients and seven healthy controls. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) receptor BP(app) (P = 0.015) and occupancy (P = 0.016) were observed between the clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol groups. The lowest occupancy was found in clozapine-treated patients (5%), followed by olanzapine-treated patients (28%), compared to haloperidol-treated patients (40%). No significant differences were observed in the temporal poles. Occupancy changed substantially depending on the comparison group used (either drug-naive vs healthy controls) in the examined brain areas (P = 0.001), showing an overestimation with all antipsychotics when the healthy control group was used. CONCLUSION: Both typical and second-generation antipsychotics occupy cortical dopamine D(2/3) receptors, thus mediating therapeutic efficacy. Observed differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) occupancy between classical antipsychotics and second-generation antipsychotics may have clinical relevance by modulating altered nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission during the acute phase of schizophrenia.
