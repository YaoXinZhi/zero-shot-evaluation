Molecular aspects of cyclophilins mediating therapeutic actions of their ligands.
Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive cyclic peptide that binds with a high affinity to 18 kDa human cyclophilin-A (hCyPA). CsA and its several natural derivatives have some pharmacological potential in treatment of diverse immune disorders. More than 20 paralogues of CyPA are expressed in the human body while expression levels and functions of numerous ORFs encoding cyclophilin-like sequences remain unknown. Certain derivatives of CsA devoid of immunosuppressive activity may have some potential in treatments of Alzheimer diseases, Hepatitis C and HIV infections, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, asthma and various parasitic infections. Here, we discuss structural and functional aspects of the human cyclophilins and their interaction with various intra-cellular targets that can be under the control of CsA or its complexes with diverse cyclophilins that are selectively expressed in different cellular compartments. Some molecular aspects of the cyclophilins expressed in parasites invading humans and causing diseases were also analyzed.
