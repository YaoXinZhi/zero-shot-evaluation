Injectable PLA-based in situ forming implants for controlled release of Ivermectin a BCS Class II drug: solvent selection based on physico-chemical characterization.
In situ forming implants (ISI) prepared from biodegradable polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) and biocompatible solvents can be used to obtain sustained drug release after parenteral administration. The aim of this work was to study the effect of several biocompatible solvents with different physico-chemical properties on the release of ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic BCS II drug, from in situ forming PLA-based implants. The solvents evaluated were N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 2-pyrrolidone (2P), triacetine (TA) and benzyl benzoate (BB). Hansen's solubility parameters of solvents were used to explain polymer/solvent interactions leading to different rheological behaviours. The stability of the polymer and drug in the solvents were also evaluated by size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The two major factors determining the rate of IVM release from ISI were miscibility of the solvent with water and the viscosity of the polymer solutions. In general, the release rate increased with increasing water miscibility of the solvent and decreasing viscosity in the following order NMP>2P>TA>BB. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a relationship between the rate of IVM release and the surface porosity of the implants, release being higher as implant porosity increased. Finally, drug and polymer stability in the solvents followed the same trends, increasing when polymer-solvent affinities and water content in solvents decreased. IVM degradation was accelerated by the acid environment generated by the degradation of the polymer but the drug did not affect PLA stability.
