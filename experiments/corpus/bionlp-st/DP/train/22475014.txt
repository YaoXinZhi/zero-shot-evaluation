Glaucogenin E, a new C21 steroid from Cynanchum stauntonii.
Glaucogenin E (1), a new C(21) steroid sapogenin, along with three known ones (2-4) were isolated from the rhizomes of Cynanchum stauntonii (Decne.) Schltr. ex Levl. Their structures were established mainly by the spectroscopic analysis, including 2D NMR. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines HeLa, Bel-7402, SGC-7901 and BGC-823.
