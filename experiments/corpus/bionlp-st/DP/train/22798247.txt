Increased expression of P450scc and CYP17 in development of endogenous hyperandrogenism in a rat model of PCOS.
The objective of the present study was to characterize the effect of insulin plus hCG on the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (P450scc and CYP17) in polycystic ovaries of rats. Changes in estrous cycle, ovarian morphology, hormonal levels, and protein levels by immunohistochemistry and western-blot were determined. Rats treated with insulin plus hCG displayed abnormal estrous cycles with increasing androgen biosynthesis. Meanwhile, insulin plus hCG resulted in multiple large cysts with diminished granulosa layers and increased thecal layers and stromal-interstitial tissue. Moreover, there was an increase in the expression of P450scc and CYP17 in thecal and stromal cells in our PCOS rat model compared with control rats. These results indicate that administration of insulin with hCG can synergistically result in endogenous hyperandrogenism which may partially upregulate the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in ovarian tissue.
