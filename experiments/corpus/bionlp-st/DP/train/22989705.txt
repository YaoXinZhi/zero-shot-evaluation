Pioglitazone protects against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in rats and potentiates its anticancer activity against human renal adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is a serious problem that limits its use in cancer treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the renal protective capacity of pioglitazone to reduce the cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity. The underlying suggested mechanism(s) and whether this nephroprotective effect (if any) interferes with the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on cancer cells were also investigated. Pioglitazone, Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, BADGE, IP injected (Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) antagonist), or their combination were administered to rats one hour before cisplatin injection. Moreover, their effects on the cell viability of human renal adenocarcinoma cell models (ACHN) were studied. The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function, structural changes, renal malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) genes expression in cisplatin injected rats. It increased both renal reduced glutathione (GSH) content and PPAR-γ gene expression. In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of BADGE. Pioglitazone also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells and this effect was abolished by BADGE co administration. In conclusion, these results suggested that pioglitazone protected against cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity through its interaction with PPAR-γ receptors and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, pioglitazone did not interfere but rather potentiated the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells.
