Inhibition of EGF/EGFR activation with naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione blocks migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.
Naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (NFD), a bioactive component of Avicennia marina, has been demonstrated to display anti-cancer activity. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced signaling pathway has been correlated with cancer metastasis in various tumors, including breast carcinoma. We use EGF as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of NFD on cell migration and invasion. NFD suppressed EGF-mediated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity. NFD abrogated EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. The specific PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked significantly EGF-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibited EGF-induced MMP-9 expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt, suggesting that PI3K/Akt activation occur downstream of EGFR activation. These findings suggest that NFD inhibited the EGF-induced invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via EGFR-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to the down-regulation of MMP-9 expression. These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the role of NFD as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MDA-MB-231 cells.
