Platelet-derived growth factor triggers PKA-mediated signalling by a redox-dependent mechanism in rat renal mesangial cells.
Inflammatory glomerular kidney diseases are often accompanied with a massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect the function of the glomerular filtration barrier and contribute to mesangiolysis via the induction of cell death in mesangial cells. Intriguingly, ROS also trigger fine-tuned signalling processes that affect gene expression and cell proliferation or migration. To define such redox-driven signalling devices, a proteomics approach was performed to identify the formation of protein complexes induced by ROS. To this end, protein lysates of human podocytes were treated with or without hydrogen peroxide (250 Î¼M). Thereafter cell lysates were subjected to diagonal 2D gel electrophoresis and putative redox-affected proteins were analysed by MS/MS analysis. Among others, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) could be identified that forms homodimers under oxidative conditions. To evaluate whether ROS dependent dimerization of PKA also occurs in a more physiological setting, rat mesangial cells were treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to induce ROS formation. This regimen resulted in a redox dependent dimerization of the R-subunits of PKA. To demonstrate whether PDGF-BB induced ROS formation affects PKA dependent pathways, the effects of PDGF-BB on phosphorylation of serine 157 of vasodilator stimulated protein (VASP) a classical target of PKA were analysed. Interestingly PDGF-BB induced VASP phosphorylation in a ROS dependent manner but independent of changes in cAMP levels. Taken together, we demonstrate a redox-mediated activation of PKA by PDGF-BB thus highlighting a physiological role of ROS as regulator of PKA activity in rat mesangial cells.
