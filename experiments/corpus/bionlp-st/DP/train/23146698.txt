Hepatoprotective effects of Gentiana asclepiadea L. extracts against carbon tetrachloride induced liver injury in rats.
This study is an attempt to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of Gentiana asclepiadea L. against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats. Methanol extracts of aerial parts (GAA) and roots (GAR) of G. asclepiadea at doses of 100, 200, and 400mg/ kg b.w. were orally administered to Wistar rats once daily for 7 days before they were treated with CCl(4). The hepatoprotective activity of the extracts in this study was compared with the reference drug silymarin. In CCl(4) treated animals, GAA and GAR significantly decreased levels of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, and increased the level of total protein. Treatment with the extracts resulted in a significant increase in the levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione, accompanied with a marked reduction in the levels of malondialdehyde, as compared to CCl(4) treated group. The histopathological studies confirmed protective effects of extracts against CCl(4)-induced liver injuries. No genotoxicity was observed in liver cells after GAA treatment, while GAR showed only slight genotoxic effects by comet assay. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of sweroside, swertiamarin and gentiopicrin in high concentrations in both extracts. It could be concluded that the use of G. asclepiadea extracts in the treatment of chemical-induced hepatotoxicity.
