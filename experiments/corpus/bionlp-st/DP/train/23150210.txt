Synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationships of selective BCRP inhibitors.
The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. This protein has a number of physiological functions, including protection of the human body from xenobiotics. The overexpression of BCRP in certain tumor cell lines causes cross-resistance against various drugs used in chemotherapeutic treatment. In a previous work we showed that a new class of compounds derived from XR9576 (tariquidar) selectively inhibits BCRP. In this work we synthesized more members of this class, with modification on the second and third aromatic rings. The inhibitory activities against BCRP and P-gp were assayed using a Hoechst 33342 assay for BCRP and a calcein AM assay for P-gp. Finally, quantitative structure-activity relationships for both aromatic rings were established. The results obtained show the importance of the electron density on the third aromatic ring, influenced by substituents, pointing to interactions with aromatic residues of the protein binding site. In the second aromatic ring the activity of compounds is influenced by the steric volume of the substituents.
