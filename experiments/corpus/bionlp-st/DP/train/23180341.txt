Chemical constituents from the fungus Amauroderma amoiensis and their in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.
One new compound named amauroamoienin (1), together with thirteen known compounds (2-14), was isolated from the EtOAc extract of Amauroderma amoiensis. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by the analysis of 1D and 2Dâ€‰spectroscopic data and the MS technique. The bioassays of inhibitory activities of these isolates against acetylcholinesterase were evaluated, and compounds 1, 3, and 5 exhibited acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.
