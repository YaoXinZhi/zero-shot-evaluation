Liver X Receptors and female reproduction: when cholesterol meets fertility!
The role of cholesterol in female reproductive physiology has been suspected for a long time, while the molecular bases were unknown. Cholesterol is the precursor of ovarian steroid biosynthesis and is also essential for fertility. In the uterus, cholesterol is essential to achieve correct contractions at term, but an excessive uterine cholesterol concentration has been associated with contractility defects. Liver X Receptor (LXR) α and LXR β are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. Since their discovery, the role of LXR in the control of cholesterol homeostasis has been widely described. Beyond their cholesterol-lowering role, more recent data have linked these nuclear receptors to various physiological processes. In particular, they control ovarian endocrine and exocrine functions, as well as uterine contractility. Their contribution to female reproductive cancers will also be discussed. This review will try to enlighten on the LXR as a molecular link between dietary cholesterol and reproductive diseases in women. In the future, a better comprehension of the various physiological processes regulated by the LXR will help to develop new ligands to prevent or to cure these pathologies in women.
