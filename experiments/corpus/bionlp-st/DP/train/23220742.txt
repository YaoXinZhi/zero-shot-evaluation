The selective SYK inhibitor P505-15 (PRT062607) inhibits B cell signaling and function in vitro and in vivo and augments the activity of fludarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
B-cell receptor (BCR) associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) contribute to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. SYK is persistently phosphorylated in a subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and SYK inhibition results in abrogation of downstream kinase activity and apoptosis. P505-15 (also known as PRT062607) is a novel, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule SYK inhibitor (SYK IC(50) = 1 nM) with anti-SYK activity that is at least 80-fold greater than its affinity for other kinases. We evaluated the preclinical characteristics of P505-15 in models of NHL and CLL. P505-15 successfully inhibited SYK-mediated B-cell receptor signaling and decreased cell viability in NHL and CLL. Oral dosing in mice prevented BCR-mediated splenomegaly and significantly inhibited NHL tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, combination treatment of primary CLL cells with P505-15 plus fludarabine produced synergistic enhancement of activity at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings support the ongoing development of P505-15 as a therapeutic agent for B-cell malignancies. A dose finding study in healthy volunteers has been completed.
