Modulation of multidrug resistance in cancer cells by chelidonine and Chelidonium majus alkaloids.
Cancer cells often develop multidrug resistance (MDR) which is a multidimensional problem involving several mechanisms and targets. This study demonstrates that chelidonine and an alkaloid extract from Chelidonium majus, which contains protoberberine and benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids, has the ability to overcome MDR of different cancer cell lines through interaction with ABC-transporters, CYP3A4 and GST, by induction of apoptosis, and cytotoxic effects. Chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited P-gp/MDR1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 and reversed their doxorubicin resistance. In addition, chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited the activity of the drug modifying enzymes CYP3A4 and GST in a dose-dependent manner. The alkaloids induced apoptosis in MDR cells which was accompanied by an activation of caspase-3, -8,-6/9, and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure. cDNA arrays were applied to identify differentially expressed genes after treatment with chelidonine and the alkaloid extract. The expression analysis identified a common set of regulated genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug metabolism. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 50 μg/ml alkaloid extract and 50 μM chelidonine for up to 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in mRNA levels of P-gp/MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, CYP3A4, GST, and hPXR and in a significant increase in caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA. Thus, chelidonine is a promising model compound for overcoming MDR and for enhancing cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics, especially against leukaemia cells. Its efficacy needs to be confirmed in animal models.
