Preparation of highly porous gastroretentive metformin tablets using a sublimation method.
The present investigation is aimed to formulate floating gastroretentive tablets containing metformin using a sublimation material. In this study, the release of the drug from a matrix tablet was highly dependent on the polymer concentrations. In all formulations, initial rapid drug release was observed, possibly due to the properties of the drug and polymer. The effect of the amount of PEO on swelling and eroding of the tablets was determined. The water-uptake and erosion behavior of the gastroretentive (GR) tablets were highly dependent on the amount of PEO. The water-uptake increased with increasing PEO concentration in the tablet matrix. The weight loss from tablets decreased with increasing amounts of PEO. Camphor was used as the sublimation material to prepare GR tablets that are low-density and easily floatable. Camphor was changed to pores in the tablet during the sublimation process. SEM revealed that the GR tablets have a highly porous morphology. Floating properties of tablets and tablet density were affected by the sublimation of camphor. Prepared floating gastroretentive tablets floated for over 24 h and had no floating lag time. However, as the amount of camphor in the tablet matrix increased, the crushing strength of the tablet decreased after sublimation. Release profiles of the drug from the GR tablets were not affected by tablet density or porosity. In pharmacokinetic studies, the mean plasma concentration of the GR tablets after oral administration was greater than the concentration of glucophase XR. Also, the mean AUC(0-âˆž) values for the GR tablets were significantly greater than the plasma concentrations of glucophase XR.
