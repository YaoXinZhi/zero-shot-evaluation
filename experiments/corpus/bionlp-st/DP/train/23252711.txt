Comparative structural and functional studies of 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile CDK9 inhibitors suggest the basis for isotype selectivity.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 9/cyclin T, the protein kinase heterodimer that constitutes positive transcription elongation factor b, is a well-validated target for treatment of several diseases, including cancer and cardiac hypertrophy. In order to aid inhibitor design and rationalize the basis for CDK9 selectivity, we have studied the CDK-binding properties of six different members of a 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series that bind to both CDK9/cyclin T and CDK2/cyclin A. We find that for a given CDK, the melting temperature of a CDK/cyclin/inhibitor complex correlates well with inhibitor potency, suggesting that differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a useful orthogonal measure of inhibitory activity for this series. We have used DSF to demonstrate that the binding of these compounds is independent of the presence or absence of the C-terminal tail region of CDK9, unlike the binding of the CDK9-selective inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazone-1-Î²-d-ribofuranoside (DRB). Finally, on the basis of 11 cocrystal structures bound to CDK9/cyclin T or CDK2/cyclin A, we conclude that selective inhibition of CDK9/cyclin T by members of the 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series results from the relative malleability of the CDK9 active site rather than from the formation of specific polar contacts.
