Synthesis, crystal structure and antidiabetic activity of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino) phenylprop-2-en-1-one.
A novel series of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-onewere synthesized starting from 2-aminobenzothiazole and 1-aryl-3,3-bis- (methylsulfanyl)-2-propen-1-onesin the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium hydride in THF. The synthesised compounds' structures were confirmed by IR, Mass spectrometry, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS spectral data. These compounds were evaluated for their antidiabetic activity, and most of the derivatives of (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-one displayed significant antidiabetic activity.
