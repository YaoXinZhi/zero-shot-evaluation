Antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity of selenium exopolysaccharide produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
Exopolysaccharide (EPS) was isolated and purified from Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis culture broth. Selenium chloride oxide (SeCl(2)O) was added to the EPS to synthesize selenium-exopolysaccharide (Se-EPS). The in vitro and in vivo antioxidant and in vivo immunomodulatory activity of EPS and Se-EPS were compared. EPS and Se-EPS scavenged superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. They also increased catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum and in the livers of mice. Se-EPS showed stronger in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity than were shown by EPS. The in vivo immunoenhancement activity of EPS and Se-EPS induced by cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment in immunosuppressed mice was researched. EPS and Se-EPS treatments increased macrophage phagocytosis, spleen and thymus indices and haemolytic complement activity (HC(50)). Se-EPS showed stronger immunomodulatory activity than did EPS.
