The antioxidant activity of teas measured by the FRAP method adapted to the FIA system: optimising the conditions using the response surface methodology.
This study proposes a FRAP assay adapted to FIA system with a merging zones configuration. The FIA system conditions were optimised with the response surface methodology using the central composite rotatable design. The optimisation parameters studied were: the carrier flow rate, the lengths of the sample and reagent loops, and reactor length. The conditions selected in accordance with the results were: carrier flow rate of 1.00 ml/min, length of the loops 18.2 cm and length of the reaction coil 210.1 cm. The detection and quantification limits were, respectively, 28.6 and 86.8 Î¼mol/l Fe(2+), and the precision was 1.27%. The proposed method had an analytical frequency of 30 samples/h and about 95% less volume of FRAP reagent was consumed. The FRAP assay adapted to the FIA system under the optimised conditions was utilised to determine the antioxidant activity of tea samples.
