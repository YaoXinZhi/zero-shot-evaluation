Structure and antioxidant activity of β-lactoglobulin-glycoconjugates obtained by high-intensity-ultrasound-induced Maillard reaction in aqueous model systems under neutral conditions.
Sonication is a new processing technology in the dairy industry. The aim of this study was to test glycation of β-lactoglobulin (BLG) in Maillard reaction (MR) induced by high-intensity ultrasound in aqueous solution under neutral conditions at 10-15 °C, which is not favourable for the MR. BLG was sonicated in the presence of glucose, galactose, lactose, fructose, ribose and arabinose. Formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) was monitored by mass spectrometry, spectrophotometry and fluorimetry. Ultrasound treatment resulted in formation of MRPs with all tested carbohydrates. Ribose induced the highest degree of modification resulting in 76% of BLG modified and an average of three anhydroribose units attached. Circular dichroism spectra analyses indicated only minor alterations in secondary and tertiary structures. MRP obtained by ultrasound exhibited 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and possessed increased iron-chelating activity and reducing power. High-intensity ultrasound efficiently promotes BLG-glycoconjugates formation by MR in aqueous solutions under non-denaturing conditions.
