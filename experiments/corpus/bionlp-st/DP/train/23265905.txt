Design and synthesis of novel 2-methyl-4,5-substitutedbenzo[f]-3,3a,4,5-tetrahydro-pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepin-8(7H)-one derivatives as telomerase inhibitors.
Eight novel 4,5-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepine derivatives have been synthesized and purified to be screened for anticancer activity. By a modified TRAP assay, some titled compounds were tested against telomerase, and compound 4a showed the most potent inhibitory activity with IC(50) value at 0.78 ± 0.22 μM. Western blot assays showed that compounds 4a and 4b could inhibit expression of Cyclin D1, TERT, phospho-AKT and PI3K/AKT pathway.
