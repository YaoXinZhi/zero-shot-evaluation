The inhibition of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway is involved in the promotion effect of arsenite on benzo(a)pyrene-induced cell transformation.
Both arsenite and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are known human carcinogens. Studies on the mode-of-action of arsenite indicate that it can also act as co-carcinogen or as a cancer promoter, and that it can facilitate progression of cancers. Some studies on development of lung cancers have suggested a synergism between arsenite exposure and cigarette smoking. The mechanism of action for such an effect, however, remains obscure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HIF-2α on arsenite- and BaP-induced cell malignant transformation as well as on signal transduction pathways in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The results show that arsenite accelerates the neoplastic transformation and migration of cells and enhances chromosomal aberrations induced by BaP. HIF-2α is involved in blocking the effects of arsenite in activating the ATM/Chk-2 pathway and in repair of DNA damage induced by BaP. Moreover, blocking of HIF-2α prevents the effects of arsenite on the neoplastic transformation, cell migration, and chromosomal aberrations caused by BaP. These results indicate that the repressive effect of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway leads to genomic instability, which is involved in arsenite-accelerated, BaP-induced malignant transformation of HBE cells.
