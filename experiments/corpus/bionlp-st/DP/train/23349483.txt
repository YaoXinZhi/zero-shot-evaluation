Reduction of reactive oxygen species ameliorates metabolism-secretion coupling in islets of diabetic GK rats by suppressing lactate overproduction.
We previously demonstrated that impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (IS) and ATP elevation in islets of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a non-obese model of diabetes, were significantly restored by 30∼60 min suppression of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. In this study, we investigated the effect of longer (12 h) suppression of ROS on metabolism-secretion coupling in β-cells by exposure to tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimic, plus ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimic (TE-treatment). In GK islets, both H(2)O(2) and superoxide were sufficiently reduced and glucose-induced IS and ATP elevation were improved by TE-treatment. Glucose oxidation, an indicator of Krebs cycle velocity, also was improved by TE-treatment at high glucose, whereas glucokinase activity, which determines glycolytic velocity, was not affected. Lactate production was markedly increased in GK islets and TE-treatment reduced lactate production and protein expression of lactate dehydrogenase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). These results indicate that the Warburg-like effect, which is characteristic of aerobic metabolism in cancer cells by which lactate is overproduced with reduced linking to mitochondria metabolism, plays an important role in impaired metabolism-secretion coupling in diabetic β-cells and suggest that ROS reduction can improve mitochondrial metabolism by suppressinglactate overproduction through inhibition of HIF1α stabilization.
