TCDD and corticosterone on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm in rats.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an endocrine-disrupting environmental pollutant, has been found to cause male reproductive toxicity. Glucocorticoids have been found to influence the metabolic pathway of TCDD. Stress, which affects the male reproductive function, is marked by an increase in the level and activity of glucocorticoids in the body. The present study was carried out to understand the effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and sperm antioxidant system under the influence of increased level of corticosterone in the body. Adult male rats were treated with either TCDD (100 ng/kg bw/ day) or corticosterone (3 mg/kg bw/day) or both for 15 days. Treatment with either TCDD or corticosterone was found to suppress the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and androgen-binding protein and reduce the activities of steroidogenic enzymes in testis while increasing oxidative stress in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm. In rats treated with both TCDD and corticosterone, the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis and increase in oxidative stress observed in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm were significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. The levels of Fas and FasL proteins were also increased in rats subjected to either TCDD or corticosterone treatment. In rats treated with both compounds, the increase observed in testicular levels of Fas and FasL was significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. Effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm may get enhanced under increased level of glucocorticoids in the body.
