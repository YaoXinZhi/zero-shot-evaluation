Accurate quantum chemical energies for tetrapeptide conformations: why MP2 data with an insufficient basis set should be handled with caution.
High-level quantum chemical calculations have been carried out for biologically-relevant conformers of tetrapeptides. Our results indicate potential problems if the widely-applied MP2 approach is used in such situations with basis sets of insufficient size. Efficient alternatives are discussed.
