Oligomeric procyanidins of lotus seedpod inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products by scavenging reactive carbonyls.
It has been reported that oligomeric procyanidins of lotus seedpod (LSOPC) is effective in the alleviation of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes through its antioxidant and insulin-potentiating activities. This study investigated the anti-glycative activity of LSOPC in a bovine serum albumin (BSA)-glucose model. The level of glycation and conformational alterations were assessed by specific fluorescence, Congo red binding assay and circular dichroism. The results show that LSOPC has a significant anti-glycative activity in vitro and it can also effectively protect the secondary structure of BSA during glycation. LSOPC or catechin (a major constituent unit of LSOPC), were used to react with methylglyoxal. The structures of their carbonyl adducts were tentatively identified using HPLC-MS(2). Their capacity to scavenge methylglyoxal suggested carbonyl scavenging as a major mechanism of antiglycation. Therefore, LSOPC could be helpful to prevent AGEs-associated diseases, and with the potential to be used as functional food ingredients.
