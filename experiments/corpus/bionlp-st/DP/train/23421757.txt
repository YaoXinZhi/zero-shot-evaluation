p53-mediated autophagy adjustment is involved in the protection of silibinin against murine dermal inflammation and epidermal apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation.
Apoptosis in murine dermal cells is retarded by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation-induced autophagic intervention while simultaneously epidermal cells commit apoptosis, during which inflammatory cytokines released from the lost epidermal cells promote immune responses of dermal inflammatory cells, forming morphological symptoms of acute cutaneous diseases. Autophagy is involved in prevention or provocation of apoptosis of dermal or epidermal cells of UVB-irradiated mice via modulation of intracellular metabolism, intervening the balance between cell death and survival in dermis and epidermis. p53 expressed in immune system affects autophagy function through activating or inactivating genes encoding apoptotic factors and inflammatory cytokines. Silibinin protects dermal and epidermal cells of UVB irradiated skin against abnormally autophagy-mediated apoptosis adjustments. In this study, how UVB irradiation intervenes autophagy in dermal and epidermal cells as well as how silibinin protects UVB irradiated skin through physiological recovering of autophagy function in dermis and epidermis are focused and elucidated preliminarily. Silibinin treatment (50Â mg/kg/day for 4 days) reversed dermal and epidermal autophagy levels from UVB irradiation-induced improper autophagy intervention, repaired the balance between cell survival and death in dermis and epidermis, and protected skin against damage through mediation of p53 activation in dermal and epidermal cells.
