Exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, prevents osteopnia by promoting bone formation and suppressing bone resorption in aged ovariectomized rats.
Osteoporosis mainly affects postmenopausal women and older men. Gastrointestinal hormones released after meal ingestion, such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2, have been shown to regulate bone turnover. However, whether GLP-1, another important gastrointestinal hormone, and its analogues also have anti-osteoporotic effects, especially in aged postmenopausal situation, is not confirmed yet. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 on ovariectomy (OVX) induced osteoporosis in old rats. Twelve-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to OVX, and exendin-4 were administrated 4 weeks after the surgery and lasted for 16 weeks. Bone characters and related serum and gene biomarkers were analyzed. Sixteen weeks treatment of exendin-4 slowed down the body weight gain by decreasing fat mass and prevented the loss of bone mass in old OVX rats. Exendin-4 also enhanced the bone strength and prevented the deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture. Moreover, exendin-4 decreased urinary DPD/creatinine ratio and serum CTX-I and increased serum ALP, OC and P1NP levels, key biochemical markers of bone turnover. Interestingly, gene expression results further showed that exendin-4 not only inhibited bone resorption by increasing OPG/RANKL ratio, but also promoted bone formation by increasing the expressions of OC, Col1, Runx2, and ALP, which exhibited dual regulatory effects on bone turnover as compared with previous anti-osteoporotic agents. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated for the first time the anti-osteoporotic effects of exendin-4 in old OVX rats and that it might be a potential candidate for treatment of aged postmenopausal osteoporosis.
