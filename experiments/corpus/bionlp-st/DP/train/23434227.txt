Synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation of oleanolic acid derivatives.
Twelve derivatives of oleanolic acid (1) have been synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activities against the growth of prostate PC3, breast MCF-7, lung A549, and gastric BGC-823 cancer cells by MTT assays. Within these series of derivatives, compound 17 exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against PC3 cell line (IC50=0.39 μM) and compound 28 displayed the best activity against A549 cell line (IC50=0.22 μM). SAR analysis indicates that H-donor substitution at C-3 position of oleanolic acid may be advantageous for improvement of cytotoxicity against PC3, A549 and MCF-7 cell lines.
