Modification of the Catalytic Function of Human Hydroxysteroid Sulfotransferase hSULT2A1 by Formation of Disulfide Bonds.
The human cytosolic sulfotransferase hSULT2A1 catalyzes the sulfation of a broad range of xenobiotics, as well as endogenous hydroxysteroids and bile acids. Reversible modulation of the catalytic activity of this enzyme could play important roles in its physiologic functions. Whereas other mammalian sulfotransferases are known to be reversibly altered by changes in their redox environment, this has not been previously shown for hSULT2A1. We have examined the hypothesis that the formation of disulfide bonds in hSULT2A1 can reversibly regulate the catalytic function of the enzyme. Three thiol oxidants were used as model compounds to investigate their effects on homogeneous preparations of hSULT2A1: glutathione disulfide, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 1,1'-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide) (diamide). Examination of the effects of disulfide bond formation with these agents indicated that the activity of the enzyme is reversibly altered. Studies on the kinetics of the hSULT2A1-catalyzed sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) showed the effects of disulfide bond formation on the substrate inhibition characteristics of the enzyme. The effects of these agents on the binding of substrates and products, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identification of the disulfides formed, and structural modeling of the modified enzyme were examined. Our results indicate that conformational changes at cysteines near the nucleotide binding site affect the binding of both the nucleotide and DHEA to the enzyme, with the specific effects dependent on the structure of the resulting disulfide. Thus, the formation of disulfide bonds in hSULT2A1 is a potentially important reversible mechanism for alterations in the rates of sulfation of both endogenous and xenobiotic substrates.
