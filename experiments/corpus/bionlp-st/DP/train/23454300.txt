Phenotypic analysis of ovine antigen presenting cells loaded with nanoparticles migrating from the site of vaccination.
Virus-sized particulate adjuvants such as ISCOMs, polystyrene nanoparticles and virus-like particles have been shown to target dendritic cells, resulting in the activation of T and B cells in vivo. Using an ovine pseudo-afferent lymph cannulation model to capture APC that traffic from the site of injection to the local lymph node, we show that 40-50nm nanoparticles are taken up at the site of injection by dendritic cells (DCs) migrating to the draining lymph node. These DCs can express CD11c, CD1b, CD5, MHC class II and CD8. Nanoparticles transported by DCs migrating from the site of injection to the local lymph node therefore needs to be considered as a new mechanism underlying the immunogenicity of virus-sized vaccine delivery systems.
