Association of cadmium and lead with antioxidant status and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients of Western India.
The association of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the pathophysiology and progression of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) has been evaluated in an epidemiological study with 116 BPH patients of the western part of India. The prostatic acid phosphatase activity, prostate-specific antigen, maximum urinary flow rate (Q max), and redox status of BPH patients were correlated with Cd and Pb contents. Additionally, patients were also separated on the basis of their age, genetic lineage, and additive habits and correlated with the Cd, Pb, and Q max levels. Our results suggest that the accumulation of toxic metals in prostate tissue has a significant positive correlation with the pathogenesis of BPH. Cd and Pb exert their effects through altered antioxidant defense mechanisms, ultimately leading to increased BPH severity. Progression of the pathogenesis also depends on other factors such as additive habits, genetic lineage, and age of the patients.
