Protective effect of bark and empty pod extracts from Acacia auriculiformis against paracetamol intoxicated liver injury and alloxan induced type II diabetes.
The present study is designed to decipher a clinical evidence and biochemical support for hepatoprotective and antidiabetic efficacy of Acacia auriculiformis by its bark and empty pods. Animal models with paracetamol intoxicated liver injury and alloxan induced diabetes were used in a 7 and 14days trial respectively. The interventions were tested at 200 and 400mg/kg b.w. for bark extract; 100 and 200mg/kg b.w. for empty pod extract. Both interventions restored the liver function markers (alanine transaminase: ALT, aspartate transaminase: AST, alkaline phosphatase: ALP, total bilirubin and total protein) and hepatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase: SOD, catalase: CAT, reduced glutathione: GSH and glutathione peroxidase: GPx) to the normal levels than elevated levels noticed on paracetamol control at P<0.001. Reversal of hepatoarchitecture has also been registered and the hepatoprotection is comparable to the reference drug silymarin. Similarly, substantial elevations of blood glucose, distorted lipid profile (total cholesterol: TC, triglycerides: TGs, high density lipoprotein cholesterol: HDL-C and low density lipoprotein cholesterol: LDL-C) and kidney function signs (creatinine and urea) have been refurbished to the desirable levels on par with the standard antidiabetic glibenclamide. The results signify the importance of bark and empty pod extracts of A. auriculiformis as good therapeutic candidates for liver injury and diabetes.
