A 5' flanking region of Gonadotropin Regulated Testicular RNA Helicase (GRTH/DDX25) gene directs its cell specific androgen regulated gene expression in testicular germ cells.
Gonadotropin Regulated Testicular RNA Helicase (GRTH/Ddx25) is a post-transcriptional regulator of genes that are essential for spermatid elongation and completion of spermatogenesis. It also prevents Leydig cells (LC) from gonadotropin overstimulation of androgen production. In transgenic (Tg) mice carrying deletions of the GRTH 5' flanking regions we previously demonstrated that the -1085 bp to ATG contains the elements for basal and androgen-induced LC specific expression. No expression in germ cells (GC) was found with sequences extended up to -3.6 Kb. To define regulatory regions of GRTH required for expression in GC, Tg mice were generated with 5' flanking sequence 6.4 Kb (6.4 Kb-Tg) and/or deletion using GFP as reporter gene in the present study. GFP was expressed in all lines. Immuno-histochemistry analysis showed that 6.4Kb-Tg directed GFP expression in both GC and LC. Deletion of the sequence -205 bp to -3.6 Kb (6.4Kb/del-Tg) directs GFP expression only in meiotic and haploid GCs. This indicated that the distal region -6.4 Kb/-3.6 Kb is required for GRTH cell specific expression in GC. Also, it inhibits the expression of GRTH in LC directed by the 205 bp promoter, an effect that is neutralized by the -3.6Kb/-205bp sequence. Flutamide treatment prevents GFP/GRTH expression in Tg lines demonstrating in vivo direct and indirect effects of endogenous androgen on GC and LC, respectively. Our studies have generated and characterized transgenic lines that can be utilized to define requirements for cell specific expression of the GRTH gene and to further advance our knowledge on the regulation of GRTH by androgen in germ cells.
