Antioxidant capacity, polyphenolic content and tandem HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS profiling of phenolic compounds from the South American berries Luma apiculata and L. chequén.
Native Myrtaceae fruits were gathered by South American Amerindians as a food source. At present, there is still some regional consume of the small berries from trees belonging to genus Luma that occurs in southern Chile and Argentina. The aerial parts and berries from Luma apiculata and Luma chequen were investigated for phenolic constituents and antioxidant capacity. A high performance electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry method was developed for the rapid identification of phenolics in polar extracts from both species. Thirty-one phenolic compounds were detected and 27 were identified or tentatively characterised based on photodiode array UV-vis spectra (DAD), ESI-MS-MS spectrometric data and spiking experiments with authentic standards. Twelve phenolic compounds were detected in L. apiculata fruits and 12 in the aerial parts while L. chequen yielded 10 compounds in fruits and 16 in aerial parts, respectively. From the compounds occurring in both Luma species, seven were identified as tannins or their monomers, 15 were flavonol derivatives and five were anthocyanins. The whole berry and aerial parts extracts presented high antioxidant capacity in the DPPH assay (IC50 of 10.41±0.02 and 2.44±0.03μg/mL for L. apiculata, 12.89±0.05 and 3.22±0.05 for L. chequen, respectively), which can be related to the diverse range of phenolics detected. The antioxidant capacity together with the high polyphenolic contents and compounds identified can support at least in part, their use as botanical drugs. From the compounds identified in both species, 3-O-(6″-O-galloyl)-hexose derivatives of myricetin, quercetin, laricitrin and isorhamnetin are reported for the first time for the genus Luma.
