Curcumin inhibits invasion and metastasis in K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells.
Curcumin, the active constituent of dietary spice turmeric, possesses a strong potential for cancer prevention and treatment. However, there is no study to address the effects of curcumin on invasion and metastasis of thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine organs, and its incidence rates have steadily increased over recent decades. Although most indolent tumours can be effectively managed, metastatic tumours at distant secondary sites behave aggressively and currently there is no effective form of treatment. Here, for the first time it has been reported that curcumin inhibit multiple metastasis steps of K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells. Curcumin dose-dependently suppressed viability of K1 cells as well as its cell attachment, spreading, migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, curcumin could also down-regulate the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The findings showed that curcumin might be an effective tumouristatic agent for the treatment of aggressive papillary thyroid carcinomas.
