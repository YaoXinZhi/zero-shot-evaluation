In vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of pentahydroxy-pregn-14-ol, 20-one-β-d-thevetopyranoside in rats.
Polyhydroxy pregnane glycoside (PPG), a steroidal glycoside was isolated from Wattakaka volubilis Linn. (Stap.f.). PPG was evaluated for in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity using acute inflammation and chronic model of inflammation in rats and LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. PPG seemed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity in the studied models. PPG at dose level of both 5 and 10mg/kg significantly reduced the edema induced by the carrageenan in acute model of inflammation. It also showed significant anti-proliferative effect (dry pellet weight basis) in chronic model of inflammation. Cellular content of granuloma was measured by assaying activity of N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and total nucleic acid content. PPG at 5 and 10mg/kg significantly suppressed the cellular infiltration measured by total nucleic acid content. In contrast, NAG activity decreased over a period of 10 days resulting in inhibition of granuloma weight gain. PPG had a more effective response than the reference drug diclofenac sodium in both the models of inflammation. Wattakaka volubilis steroidal glycoside mixture (WVSM) and PPG (1-50μM) significantly inhibited the COX-2 and iNOS enzymes resulting in low levels of PGE2 and NO in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Hence the study supports the traditional use of Wattakaka volubilis and its constituent PPG in treatment of inflammatory disorders.
