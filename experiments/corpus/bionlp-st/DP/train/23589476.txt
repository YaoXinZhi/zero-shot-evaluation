Wired Enzyme Electrodes-A Retroperspective Story about an Exciting Time at University of Texas at Austin and Its Impact on My Scientific Career.
The present paper features an exciting time in the late 1980s when I, as a visiting scientist, had the privilege to participate in the early and very exciting development of the in vivo redox-polymer-wired glucose sensor in Professor Adam Heller's laboratory at the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Texas at Austin. This story is followed by an overview of the research my visit initiated at Uppsala University. In collaboration with Swedish colleagues, we explored a few of the many possibilities to form new biosensors by utilizing Prof. Heller's concept of cross-linked redox-polymer/redox-enzyme electrodes.
