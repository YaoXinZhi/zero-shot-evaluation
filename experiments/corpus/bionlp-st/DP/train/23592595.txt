An in Vivo Tagging Method Reveals that Ras Undergoes Sustained Activation upon Transglutaminase-Mediated Protein Serotonylation.
Don't interrupt! Protein serotonylation has been implicated in living cells, yet its role remains poorly defined because of the lack of characterization tools. We synthesized a serotonin derivative to enable selective tagging of serotonylation and to investigate its effect on Ras; the latter displayed undisrupted interaction with Raf-1 at the Ras binding domain.
