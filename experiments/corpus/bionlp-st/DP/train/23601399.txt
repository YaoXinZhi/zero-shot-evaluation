Nutrients and bioactive compounds of Thai indigenous fruits.
This study determined the nutritional potential of Thai indigenous fruits in terms of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activities. Three indigenous fruits were collected at two conservation areas in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand. The results showed that Phyllanthus emblica L. exhibited the highest levels of vitamin C (575±452mg/100g), total phenolics (TP) (3703±1244mGAE/100g), and antioxidant activities, as measured by DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. Compared to the other two fruits, Antidesma velutinosum Blume contained higher levels of most nutrients and dietary fibre (15.6±5.9g/100g), as well as carotenoids (335±98μg/100g) and phytosterols (22.1±3.9mg/100g). Spondias pinnata (L.f.) Kurz was high in total phenolics (3178±887mGAE/100g) and antioxidant activity. Moreover, high correlations were found between TP and antioxidant activities (r>0.9). These Thai indigenous fruits are potentially good sources of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activities. Conservation and utilisation should be promoted for food security and consumption as part of a healthy diet.
