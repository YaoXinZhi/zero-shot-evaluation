Biogenic amines content as a measure of the quality of wines of Abruzzo (Italy).
Aim of this research was to study the effect of some agronomic and oenological factors on the content of biogenic amines as quality index of sixty-five Abruzzo wines. Sum of amines was found to be decreasing in the order: red (19.3±12.8mgL(-1)), rosé (9.20±6.34mgL(-1)), white (7.67±3.84mgL(-1)) wine. Significant differences in relationship among amines levels and chemical and chemico-physical characteristics of red, white and rosé wine are due to their different biotechnological process and winemaking. Besides the aging treatment, influential seems to be the effect of the winery, regardless of the area in which it is situated. The single amines significantly correlated with their sum were putrescine, histamine and tyramine, even if reached levels were below toxicity threshold, demonstrating a good quality of the wines of Abruzzo whose consumption is no risk to the health of the consumer following the rules of proper nutrition.
