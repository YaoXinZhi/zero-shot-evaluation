A Dual Enzyme Microgel with High Antioxidant Ability Based on Engineered Seleno-Ferritin and Artificial Superoxide Dismutase.
An antioxidant microgel with both glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities is reported. Using computational design and genetic engineering methods, the main catalytic components of GPx are fabricated onto the surface of ferritin. The resulting seleno-ferritin (Se-Fn) monomers can self-assemble into nanocomposites that exhibit remarkable GPx activity due to the well organized multi-GPx catalytic centers. Subsequently, a porphyrin derivative is synthesized as an SOD mimic, and is employed to construct a synergistic dual enzyme system by crosslinking Se-Fn nanocomposites into a microgel. Significantly, this dual enzyme microgel is demonstrated to display better antioxidant ability than single GPx or SOD mimics in protecting cells from oxidative damage.
