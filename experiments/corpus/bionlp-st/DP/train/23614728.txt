Adenovirus-delivered angiopoietin-1 treatment for phosgene-induced acute lung injury.
Abstract Context: Exposure to phosgene can result in an acute lung injury, leading to pulmonary edema and even death. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is a critical factor for vascular stabilization due to its ability to reduce endothelial permeability and inflammation. Objective: In this study, the histopathological changes of the lungs after exposure to phosgene and the effect of Ang1 treatment were examined. Materials and methods: Rats were exposed to phosgene gas at 8.33 g/m(3) for 5 min. Ang1 overexpressing rats were established by an intravenous injection of adenovirus-Ang1 (Ad/Ang1). The histological changes of the lung were examined by Haematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining and fluorescence microscopy. The inferior lobe was used for the determination of the ratio of wet weight to dry weight of the lung. The concentration of cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The pathological analysis showed signs of inflammation and edema, evident from a significant increase in the number of leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the ratio of wet to dry weight of the lungs. The lung injury induced by phosgene was markedly reduced after the injection of Ad/Ang1. The increase of IL-1β and IL-17 and decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of phosgene-exposed animals were abolished by the administration of Ad/Ang1. Discussion and conclusions: Ang1 has the beneficial effects on phosgene-induced lung injury. The adenovirus-delivered Ang1 may have the potential as a novel approach for the treatment of the acute lung injury caused by phosgene gas inhalation in humans.
