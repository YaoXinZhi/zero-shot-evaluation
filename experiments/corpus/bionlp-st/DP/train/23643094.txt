Nordihydroguaiaretic acid induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation in vivo and attenuates renal damage and apoptosis in the ischemia and reperfusion model.
It has been shown that the pretreatment with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lignan with direct and indirect antioxidant properties, protects against the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal oxidant damage. Although it has been shown that NDGA induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells in culture, it is unknown if NDGA may induce Nrf2 translocation in vivo. In this work was explored if NDGA is able to induce in vivo Nrf2 nuclear translocation in kidneys of rats submitted to uni-nephrectomy (U-NX) or I/R injury. Four groups of male Wistar rats were used: U-NX, NDGA, I/R, and I/R+NDGA. NDGA was injected i.p. (10mg/kg/day) starting 48h before I/R. Kidney samples were obtained at 3h of reperfusion after to measure Nrf2 translocation. Additional groups of rats were studied at 24h of reperfusion to measure histological damage and apoptosis. NDGA was able to induce Nrf2 translocation in vivo in kidneys of rats submitted to both U-NX and I/R injury and to protect against renal histological damage and apoptosis. It is concluded that the pretreatment of NDGA is able to induce in vivo nuclear Nrf2 translocation in kidney of rats suggesting that this may be involved in the renoprotection against I/R.
