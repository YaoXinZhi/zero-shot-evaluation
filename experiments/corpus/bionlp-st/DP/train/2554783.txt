The decrease of catalase or esterase D activity in patients with microdeletions of 11p or 13q does not increase their radiosensitivity.
Lymphocyte cultures from patients affected by retinoblastoma (Rb), with or without a microdeletion of chromosome 13, and Wilms tumor (WT), with a microdeletion of chromosome 11p where exposed to gamma-ray radiation during S and G2 phases. Chromatid and chromosome lesions were scored and compared to those observed in controls. No significant differences were detected, neither between patients and controls, nor between patients carrying or not a microdeletion. This lack of difference was unexpected since the genes for catalase and esterase D, also called S-formyl glutathione hydrolase, which are two detoxication enzymes, are deleted in case of microdeletion of 11p and 13q, respectively.
