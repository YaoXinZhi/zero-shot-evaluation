Loperamide modifies but does not block the corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced ACTH response in patients with Addison's disease.
The effect of loperamide - a peripheral opiate agonist - on plasma ACTH response to Corticotropin-releasing Hormone (CRH) has been investigated in 6 patients with Addison's disease. After placebo administration CRH induced a marked ACTH increase. After loperamide administration ACTH levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then CRH was still able to induce an ACTH increase; the pattern of ACTH response to CRH was slightly delayed. There was a significant difference between the two ACTH curves after CRH only in the early phase of the response. These data suggest that the inhibitory role of loperamide on ACTH secretion is exerted at supra-pituitary level, although a pituitary site of action can not be excluded.
