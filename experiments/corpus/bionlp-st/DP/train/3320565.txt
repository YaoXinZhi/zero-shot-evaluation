Pharmacological and clinical studies of the antiandrogen Anandron.
This paper summarizes the animal and human studies with Anandron available at the time of the meeting. The following was demonstrated in the rat and confirmed in man: interaction of Anandron with the prostatic androgen receptor, antiandrogen activity against testosterone (in particular against the early transient rise induced by LHRH analogs) and adrenal androgens. Thus, as shown in 4 different double blind studies performed in stage D2 prostrate cancer patients, the combination of Anandron with surgical or chemical castration enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone and thus seems a step forward in the hormonal treatment of prostatic carcinoma.
