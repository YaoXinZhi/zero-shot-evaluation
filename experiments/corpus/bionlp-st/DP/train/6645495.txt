Binding of progestagens to receptor proteins in MCF-7 cells.
With the aim of finding an explanation for the biological properties of progestagens currently used for contraceptive purposes, we have assessed their specificity for progesterone, androgen and oestrogen receptors in MCF-7 cells. The specificity of progestagens for the progesterone receptors in the cytosol fraction of MCF-7 cells was similar to that for progesterone receptors in human and rabbit myometrial cytosol but different from that for the progesterone receptor in rat myometrial cytosol. At 37 degrees C the relative affinity of 3-keto-desogestrel, the major metabolite of desogestrel, for the progesterone receptor in intact MCF-7 cells was twice that of levonorgestrel and Org 2058, three times that of medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA), 4.5 times that of norethisterone and 5 times that of progesterone and cyproterone acetate whereas at 4 degrees C in the cytosol fraction of MCF-7 cells exposed to molybdate (nontransformed receptor complexes) 3-keto-desogestrel and Org 2058 displayed similar affinity. The stronger binding of 3-keto-desogestrel in intact cells was due to the higher stability of its complex with the progesterone receptor. At 37 degrees C the relative affinity of 3-keto-desogestrel for the androgen receptor in intact MCF-7 cells was half that of levonorgestrel, similar to that of norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and at least three times higher than that of progestagens with anti-androgenic activity whereas at 4 degrees C in the cytosol fraction exposed to molybdate there was no clear difference between the relative affinities of progestagens with androgenic and anti-androgenic properties. Of the progestagens tested in this study, only norethinodrel displayed measurable but very low relative affinity for the oestrogen receptor in MCF-7 cells. We conclude that the present results of binding studies with intact MCF-7 cells correlate better with the known hormonal properties of progestagens than those obtained with the cytosol fraction exposed to molybdate at 4 degrees C.
