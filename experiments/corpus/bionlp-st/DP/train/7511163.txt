5 beta-Methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)-7,8-dihydromorphinone and its corresponding N-cyclopropylmethyl analog, N-cyclopropylmethylnor-5 beta-methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)- 7,8-dihydromorphinone: mu-selective irreversible opioid antagonists.
5 beta-Methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)-7,8-dihydromorphinone (MET-CAMO) and its corresponding N-cyclopropylmethyl analog, N-cyclopropylmethylnor-5 beta-methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)- 7,8-dihydromorphinone (N-CPM-MET-CAMO) were tested in opioid receptor binding assays and in the mouse tail-flick test in order to characterize the affinity, selectivity and antinociceptive properties of these two compounds. Incubating bovine striatal membranes with either MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO produced a wash-resistant, concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective ligand, [3H]-[D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin, but with no change in delta or kappa binding. Preincubating membranes with N-CPM-MET-CAMO decreased the maximum binding value for [3H]-[D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin binding without changing the Kd value. In the mouse tail-flick assay, MET-CAMO and N-CPM-MET-CAMO did not produce any antinociception up to a dose of 100 nmol after i.c.v. administration. However, pretreatment of mice with either compound produced a time- and dose-dependent antagonism of morphine-induced antinociception. Analgesia mediated by delta or kappa opioids was not altered by either MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO at a dose of up to 100 nmol. The mu antagonistic effect of 1 nmol of MET-CAMO and N-CPM-MET-CAMO appeared at 8 hr and lasted up to 72 hr, with a maximal effect at 16 to 24 hr after i.c.v. administration. Pretreatment of mice with 1 nmol of MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO, given by i.c.v. administration at -24 hr, produced a rightward and downward shift of dose-response line of i.c.v. morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
