Characterization of an alpha 1D-adrenoceptor mediating the contractile response of rat aorta to noradrenaline.
1. The affinities of a number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined by displacement of [3H]-prazosin binding from cloned human alpha 1A-adrenoceptors (previously designated cloned alpha 1c subtype), alpha 1B alpha 1D and rat alpha 1D-adrenoceptors, stably expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts. Functional affinity estimates for these compounds were also determined from noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta. 2. BMY 7378 displayed high affinity for cloned human alpha 1D-adrenoceptors (pKi = 8.2 +/- 0.10) and was selective over alpha 1A (pKi = 6.2 +/- 0.10) and alpha 1B subtypes (6.7 +/- 0.11). WB 4101, benoxathian and phentolamine displayed high affinity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors compared to the alpha 1B subtype. Spiperone displayed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1B adrenoceptors (pKi 8.8 +/- 0.16). 5-Methyl-urapidil was selective for cloned alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 3. Comparative binding affinities (pKi) for compounds at cloned human and rat1D adrenoceptors were almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08). 4. Prazosin, doxazosin and 5-methyl-urapidil were potent, competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta (pA2 values of 9.8, 8.8 and 7.8 respectively). The selective alpha 1D antagonist BMY 7378 was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pKB = 8.3 +/- 0.1) but the interaction of this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors. 5. Functional affinities for compounds determined against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta correlated well with binding affinities at cloned alpha 1D-adrenoceptors (r = 0.96), but not with alpha 1A (r = 0.61) or alpha 1B (r = 0.46) subtypes. 6. Noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of chlorethylclonidine (CEC). CEC (10 microM) caused a small rightward shift in the noradrenaline concentration-response curve. CEC at 100 microM caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum response to noradrenaline.7. The results of this study suggest that noradrenaline predominantly, but not exclusively, mediates contraction of rat aorta through the activation of an alphalD-adrenoceptor.
