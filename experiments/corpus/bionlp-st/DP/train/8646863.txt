Fluticasone propionate: safety profile.
Fluticasone propionate is a potent fluorinated corticosteroid used for the topical therapy of dermatoses and as inhalation therapy for bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. This agent has a good safety profile with a low propensity for systemic side effects, such as suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and a low incidence of local side effects such as pruritus, burning, or skin atrophy. The pharmacologic properties of fluticasone propionate-including high lipophilicity, high selectivity and affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, low systemic absorption, and rapid metabolism and clearance-combine to give fluticasone propionate a high therapeutic index.
