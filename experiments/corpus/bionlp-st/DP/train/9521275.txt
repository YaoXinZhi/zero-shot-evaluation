Testosterone versus testosterone and testolactone in treating reproductive and sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy and hypogonadism.
Antiepileptic drug-induced reductions in serum levels of biologically active testosterone and elevations in serum estradiol (E2) may contribute to sexual dysfunction among men with epilepsy. Treatment using a combination of testosterone and the aromatase inhibitor testolactone may have significantly better effects on sexual function and also seizure frequency than testosterone alone.
