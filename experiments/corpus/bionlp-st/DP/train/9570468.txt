Cataleptogenic effect of subtype selective 5-HT receptor antagonists in the rat.
5-HT receptor antagonists with selectivity for 5-HT1A WAY-100635 (N-[2-[-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohe xanecarboxamide), 5-HT1B GR 127935 (N-[methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'(5-methyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide x HCl), 5-HT2C SB 200646A (N-(1-methyl-5-indolyl)-N'-(3-pyridyl)urea x HCl) and 5-HT2A (ketanserin, fananserin and MDL 100,151 ((+/-)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-pipe ridinemethanol) receptors were tested for cataleptogenic responses in rats. WAY-100635 (0.1-3 mg/kg, s.c.), ketanserin (0.1-3 mg/kg, s.c.), MDL 100,151 (0.3-3 mg/kg, s.c.) and fananserin (RP 62203; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) induced a significant catalepsy. GR 127935 (1 mg/kg, s.c.), SB 200646A (without effect per se at 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and MDL 100,151 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) did not inhibit the cataleptic response to the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, loxapine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.). Catalepsy induced by MDL 100,151 (3 mg/kg) was blocked by co-treatment with clozapine, but not by SB 200646A (both at 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Although clozapine displays significant affinity to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the present results suggest that blockade of these receptors is not responsible for clozapine's anticataleptic activity.
