Fas and Fas ligand system may mediate antiproliferative activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor in endometrial cancer cells.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor-bearing tumors undergo apoptosis in vivo and in vitro with GnRH analogs. We recently showed that GnRH stimulation induces intratumoral expression of the apoptosis-inducing Fas ligand in human reproductive tract tumors. To provide a potential association of Fas/Fas ligand system with the antiproliferative signaling process of GnRH receptor, we evaluated a correlation between the Fas ligand expression and the number of viable cells in two types of GnRH receptor-bearing endometrial carcinomas that differ in Fas content. Surgically removed uterine endometrial carcinomas had been screened for the presence of GnRH receptor and Fas before analyses. Fas ligand protein was characterized by immunoblotting of membrane proteins with the specific antibody. After a lag time of 2 days, incubation with a GnRH analog leuprolide (10 microM) induced significant growth inhibition of the Fas- and GnRH receptor-bearing cells (p<0.01). Time course analysis showed that Fas ligand production, which was already observed at day 2 (p<0.01), precedes the onset of reduction in viable cell number. The stimulatory effect of GnRH on Fas ligand expression and reduction of viable cells revealed dose-dependency. The analog at concentration of 10 microM induced up to 90% reduction in cell number. In contrast, the growth of Fas-negative cells was not affected by the analog, although Fas ligand appeared in response to the GnRH analog (p<0.01). These data demonstrate that the co-presence of Fas could be essential for GnRH to promote antiproliferative action in endometrial cancer cells carrying GnRH receptor. The hormone may act through intratumor Fas and Fas ligand system to induced growth inhibition in GnRH-sensitive tumors.
