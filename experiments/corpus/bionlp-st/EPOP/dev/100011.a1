T10	p 565 974	 Freiburg (dpa / lsw) - The repeated sighting of a Japanese beetle in Freiburg alarmed experts. The beetle is considered an invasive species with great potential for damage. According to the Augustenberg Agricultural Technology Center (LTZ), a male Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) has now fallen into the trap of the Baden-Württemberg plant protection service. Such a specimen was found there last autumn.
T11	p 974 1403	 The agricultural experts suspect that both beetles came here as stowaways in freight or tourist traffic from northern Italy. Since May 2022, the Freiburg area has been monitored with eight pheromone traps. A surveillance network of 42 traps was set up throughout Baden-Württemberg, mainly along the main traffic arteries. This is intended to detect Japanese beetles before they can multiply and establish themselves permanently.
T12	p 1403 1721	 The approximately one centimeter large Japanese beetle with a shiny metallic green head, brown wings and small white tufts of hair has hardly any predators in Europe. It comes from Asia and is classified in the EU as a "priority Union quarantine pest" because it prefers to eat flowers, leaves, fruits or their roots.
T13	p 1721 2065	 The Japanese beetle is often confused with the garden leaf beetle or the rose chafer - these are native species that do not cause any significant damage. If you find the Japanese beetle, the LTZ Augustenberg asks you to catch, freeze and photograph it. The photo should then be emailed to [email protected], with details of where it was found.
