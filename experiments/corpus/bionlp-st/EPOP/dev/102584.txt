The genetic heritage of the flavescence dorée of the vine deciphered for the first time
Agroscope researchers have succeeded in deciphering the genetic heritage of a quarantine disease of the vine, flavescence dorée, practically impossible to fight until today. The decryption will make it possible to find weak points to fight against the pathogenic agent.
Agroscope researchers have succeeded in deciphering the genetic heritage of a quarantine disease of the vine, flavescence dorée, practically impossible to fight until today. The decryption will make it possible to find weak points to fight against the pathogenic agent. Flavescence dorée appeared for the first time in 2004 in the canton of Ticino. Since then, it has been detected in the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Grisons. Affected vines must be removed and destroyed. If infection occurs, steps are taken to control the species of leafhopper that is spreading the disease. Alternatives to the use of insecticides are sought. High specialization of the pathogen The disease is caused by phytoplasmas (bacteria that lack a cell wall). To be able to eradicate this disease, it is important to understand how the pathogen spreads and what happens to the affected plant. This is why Agroscope researchers have deciphered the genetic heritage of the pathogen. Unlike other phytoplasmas, the structure of the gene pool of this pathogen is stable. This is an essential discovery, because a stable genetic heritage means that weak points also behave in a stable way. It is therefore easier to find them and use them to eliminate the pathogen. Gene function and genetic diversity The next step is to study the function of genes revealed by genome sequencing. This will help to understand how the pathogen bypasses a plant's defenses and makes it sick. In addition, the researchers are analyzing whether these weak points are found in all strains present in Switzerland.
