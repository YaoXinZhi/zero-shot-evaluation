madd-4 plays a critical role in light against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus - Scientific Reports
Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is a notorious invasive species, causing extensive losses to pine ecosystems globally. Previous studies had shown that the development of B. xylophilus was seriously suppressed by light. However, the mechanism involved in the inhibition is unknown. Here, it is the first report that Bxy-madd-4 is a light-regulated gene, plays a potential role in B. xylophilus in responding to the blue light. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 declined by 86.39% under blue light. The reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR results were in accord with the transcriptome sequencing, confirming the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 was suppressed by blue light. Bxy-madd-4 promoter::mCherry reporter constructed in Caenorhabditis elegans were utilized to mimic the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Bxy-madd-4. Bxy-madd-4A promoter activity had a strong continuity throughout all development stages in C. elegans. Further RNA interference indicated that only 36.8% of the Bxy-madd-4 dsRNA treated embryos were hatched. Moreover, 71.6% of the hatched nematodes were abnormal, such as particles on the body surface and concave tissues. Our findings contribute towards a better understanding of the mechanism of light against the destructive invasive nematode, providing a promising hint for control of the destructive invasive nematode.

Introduction Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causal agent of the pine wilt disease causing extensive economic and ecological losses globally1,2. It was first found in Japan since the beginning of the twentieth century and spread into the neighboring countries in the late 1980s3. After devastating millions of pine trees in Asian countries, the nematode spread into Europe in the late 1990s4 and caused worldwide concern. The infection cycle of the pinewood nematode is exceptionally complicated. It feeds on parenchyma cells and propagates in the resin canals of the living pine trees5. At 25 C, the embryonic development of the nematode requires ~ 20 h (h). The second-stage juvenile (J2) emerge (the J1 within the egg) after embryogenesis and begin their feeding activity6. In the postembryonic development, J2 undergoes three additional molts before becoming adult, which requires ~ 4 days (d) at 25 C7. Within a few months, the host pine tree will wilt and die due to infection by the nematode8. The quick wilt and death of the host could be caused by the collapsing of the water conduction tissues caused by the fast losing of the parenchyma cells9. After the host dies, the nematode enters a fungivorous stage, feeding on the fungi that invaded the wilting pine tree5. B. xylophilus could not deviate from the host pine trees independently and, but depend on the insect vectors (Monochamus spp.)10. B. xylophilus intrudes into the insect vectors when the Monochamus beetles pupate in the pupal chambers and invade the new host pine trees when the adult beetle feeds or oviposits on pine trees11. Thus, at least four organisms are involved in the infection cycle of this disease: host tree, pine wood nematode as the fatal pathogen, insect vector, and fungi growing in the withering tree. To this date, although a large number of studies have been carried out to controlling pine wood nematode, no approved countermeasures have been developed. In fact, it is still rampant, causing huge economic losses and ecological threats in the past several years worldwide. An early study in Japan described that pine wilt disease development was significantly suppressed under white light illumination12. Recently, we found that population growth of B. xylophilus was significantly suppressed by the continuous illumination of white light. In general, the light sensation is vital for all organisms, from microorganisms to humans13. Besides the light irritation that makes changes in the metabolism and avoids the responses in microorganisms, it stimulates attraction responses in plants and induces non-visual or visual perception in animals14. Six photoreceptor families including cryptochromes, phototropins, BLUF proteins, rhodopsins, phytochromes, and xanthopsins, have been widely acknowledged to mediate light signal transduction in nature15. The first three have different flavin-based photochemistry, whereas the last three belong to isomerization of retinal, p-coumaric acid, and phytochromobilin. However, very few studies have examined the effects of light on nematodes. The possible molecular mechanisms of light-suppressed growth and development are not clear in nematodes. In order to clarify the molecular basis of the light suppression, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis in B. xylophilus with light and dark treatment, using the RNA-Seq technology16. The results showed that the expression level of muscle arm development defective gene (madd) was strongly suppressed by the blue light. MADD-4 is orthologous to a mammalian gene named ADAMTSL1 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type I motifs-like)17. ADAMTSL proteins are homologous with ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin domains) proteins but out of metalloprotease and disintegrin amino-terminal domains18. ADAMTS is a family of extracellular proteases found in mammals and invertebrates, playing crucial roles during embryonic development and angiogenesis19. madd-4 was firstly identified from Caenorhabditis elegans by a forward genetic screen for muscle arm extension mutants20. In C. elegans, the protein of madd-4, MADD-4, is secreted by the ventral and dorsal nerve cords to induce extending sensory axons and muscle arms17. The activity of MADD-4 is dependent on the netrin receptor, UNC-40, which functions cell-independently to guide membrane expansion17. Furthermore, MADD-4 and neurexin redundantly control the gathering of postsynaptic GABA receptors21. In the current study, we found that blue light inhibits the early embryo development of B. xylophilus. The expression level of Bxy-madd-4 showing from both RT-qPCR and RNA-seq was dramatically dropped after the irritation of the blue light during embryogenesis. The lethal and retardation phenotype of embryos were found after knockdown of the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 by RNA interference (RNAi). Therefore, our data supports the fact that that Bxy-madd-4 plays a critical role in maintaining normal embryogenesis to defend blue light in B. xylophilus. The knowledge resulting from Bxy-madd-4 would provide a hopeful clue to restraining the population growth to therefore control the invasive nematode. Results Effects of different light sources on the development of B. xylophilus Continuous illumination with white light has been demonstrated to effectively suppress the population growth of B. xylophilus12. Therefore, we undertook a series of experiments to assess the ability of different homogeneous light to disrupt development of B. xylophilus. Figure 1A shows that the population growth of B. xylophilus was significantly inhibited under different homogeneous light-emitting diode (1000 lx). The offspring were significantly reduced by 37–96% within 7 days of treatment with the different homogeneous lights. There was a > 96% reduction in the number of offspring treated with blue light. To ensure that the reduction of offspring was due to blue light, synchronized eggs were placed under blue light for different time periods. As shown in Fig. 1B, the hatching rates were sharply declined when the time reached under the blue light up to 11 h; no eggs could hatch once they had been under the blue light for over 13 h. The results clearly demonstrate that the effectiveness of blue light is able to suppress the population growth of B. xylophilus. Sequence analysis of Bxy-madd-4 Bxy-madd-4 had two isoforms, Bxy-madd-4A (GenBank accession number MT769319) and Bxy-madd-4B (GenBank accession number MT769320) (Fig. 2A). Isoform-A contained 75 bp of 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), 340 bp of 3′ UTRs, and had an open reading form (ORF) of 3375 bp, encoding a protein of 1125 amino acids. Isoform-B contained 88 bp of the 5′ UTRs and 161 bp of the 3′ UTRs and had an ORF of 2169 bp, encoding 723 amino acids. The putative functional motifs of isoform-A included six N-terminal TSP1 (thrombin sensitive protein, thrombospondin-1) motif repeats, an IG-like (immunoglobulin-like) domain, and a C-terminal TSP1 motif. Isoform-B was similar to isoform-A, except that it lacked an N-terminal TSP1 (Fig. 2B). No transmembrane helices were predicted in Bxy-MADD-4 proteins. However, it had a signal peptide, Bxy-MADD-4A signal peptide cleavage site at Ala18-Ile19, whereas Bxy-MADD-4B signal peptide cleavage site at Ala17-Val18. The phylogenetic tree of ADAMTSL1 protein showed that Bxy-MADD-4 had the highest homology level with ADAMTSL1 of the Toxocara canis, and assembled into a valid cluster with those of other nematodes (Fig. 2C). The molecular formula of Bxy-MADD-4A was estimated to be C5363H8471N1613O1662S89 with a molecular weight of 124.99 kDa and a predicted theoretical pI of 8.62. In contrast, the molecular formula of Bxy-MADD-4B was estimated to be C3459H5487N1025O1067S53 with a molecular weight of 80.20 kDa and a predicted theoretical pI of 8.58. The instability index (II) of Bxy-MADD-4A and Bxy-MADD-4B was computed to be 48.24 and 44.85, indicating that they might be unstable proteins. Validation of gene expression data using RT-qPCR RNA-seq and RT-qPCR were used to examine the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 during embryogenesis in B. xylophilus under blue light and dark conditions. The FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments) data (Supplementary Table S1) of Bxy-madd-4 in our previous RNA-seq results showed a higher expression in 10 h than that of 7 h and 13 h in dark conditions, and the blue light effectively decreased the expression level (Fig. 3A). Compared to the dark conditions, the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 under blue light was declined by 31.83% in 7 h, 86.39% in 10 h, and 61.41% in 13 h. The RT-qPCR results were consistent with the expression patterns obtained from RNA-Seq results (r = 0.983 for dark conditions and r = 0.981 for blue light conditions), confirming that the expression level of Bxy-madd-4 was suppressed by blue light (Fig. 3B). Spatial and temporal characteristics of Bxy-madd-4 To mimic the spatial and temporal expression profiles of Bxy-madd-4 at the translational level, Bxy-madd-4Ap and Bxy-madd-4Bp were cloned into the expression vectors and injected into C. elegans, respectively. During early embryogenesis (6 h), Bxy-madd-4Ap activity was detectable in several specific areas (red) of the C. elegans embryo, unlike gfp (green), which focused on only one area (Fig. 4A1–A4). During late embryogenesis (12 h), Bxy-madd-4Ap activity was detectable in most parts (red) of the embryo, and the pharynx outline formed (green) (Fig. 4B1–B4). Bxy-madd-4Ap activity had a strong continuity throughout all postembryonic stages in C. elegans. As a marker gene for pharynx, gfp (green) showed a complete structure of the pharynx in the postembryonic stages (Fig. 5). In the stage of L1, the Bxy-madd-4Ap activity was nearly present throughout the entire body from head to tail but was weakly distributed in the pharynx areas (Fig. 5A1–A4). The Bxy-madd-4Ap activity in L2 was basically the same as in L1 (Fig. 5B1–B4). In L3, L4 and adult stage, the Bxy-madd-4Ap activity presented a somewhat different result from L1 and L2 in the middle of the worms, however it was similar in other parts (Fig. 5). Bxy-madd-4Bp activity had obvious differences with that of Bxy-madd-4Ap over the course of ontogeny in C. elegans. During the embryogenesis, Bxy-madd-4Bp activity was detectable in only a few areas (red) near the pharynx (green) in the C. elegans embryo (Fig. 6). Moreover, Bxy-madd-4Bp activity continued to decrease during the postembryonic development stages of C. elegans (Fig. 7). In the adult hermaphrodite, Bxy-madd-4Bp activity was only detectable as two tiny dots, one close to the pharynx and the other in the tail. Characterization and analysis of RNAi To explore the functions of Bxy-madd-4 during the development of B. xylophilus, an RNAi strategy was used to knockdown its mRNA expression on the synchronized embryos. By comparing the expression levels of Bxy-madd-4 in the embryos soaked in the dsRNA and the control, showed RNAi led to a reduction of 84.4%, 89.8%, and 97.0% after treatment for 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 8A). For the three potential upstream or downstream genes, nrx-1, unc-40, and nlg-1, the mRNA expression levels were not significantly reduced after RNAi treatment for 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h (Fig. 8A). RNAi indicated that only 36.8% of the Bxy-madd-4 dsRNA treated embryos were hatched, whereas almost 100% of the hatching rates were observed in the control groups (Fig. 8B). Moreover, in the Bxy-madd-4 dsRNA treated group, the unhatched embryos were arrested during the development and lysed, whereas 71.6% of the hatched J2 were abnormal, such as particles on the body surface and concave tissues (Fig. 8D). The number of head thrash per 10 s was recorded to assess the influence of RNAi on the motility in B. xylophilus. In the Bxy-madd-4 dsRNA treatment group, the head thrashing frequency was 1.72 times per 10 s in the hatched J2 (Fig. 8C). In contrast, they were 4.4 times and 4.2 times per 10 s for the hatched J2 in the non-dsRNA treated control and gfp dsRNA control, respectively (Fig. 8C).
