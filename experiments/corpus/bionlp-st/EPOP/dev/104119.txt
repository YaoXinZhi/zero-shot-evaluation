OneZoom Tree of Life Explorer Meanwhile, we have taken you to the root of the OneZoom tree. The Open Tree contains additional species not on the OneZoom tree (particularly subspecies and fossils). To check if this is why we cannot find your species or group, you can look for this taxon on the Open Tree of Life, or search the taxonomy database that they maintain. However, if you canâ€™t find it via either of these links, or by searching the Open Tree, then chances are you have entered a wrong number or a misspelt name.
