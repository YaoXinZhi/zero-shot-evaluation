An Asian beetle causes a riot in Lucerne - authorities react immediately

Home Central Switzerland Canton Lucerne The Asian longhorned beetle can cause major tree damage within a short period of time. The authorities have taken immediate action. They don't have much time. "This is an event with national charisma," said Bruno Röösli, Head of the Forest Department of the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Canton of Lucerne, on Tuesday at a press conference in Zell. The reason: Asian long-horned beetles (ALB) roam the community. According to the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), the animal of East Asian origin is considered a particularly dangerous harmful organism. "The matter means a lot of worries, costs and effort for the community, canton and federal government," says Röösli. The ALB is black and has light spots distributed over the body. It is about 25–35 millimeters long without antennae, the antennae of the female are about as long as the rest of the body, those of the male twice as long. There are circular holes in the wood and, depending on the case, cracks in the bark with coarse chips or drill dust. Potential pests found should be reported immediately to the Agriculture and Forest Service by email to lawa@lu.ch. It is best to store the beetle in a jar with a perforated lid in the refrigerator. (zgc) What makes the alien bug so dangerous? In short: the pest attacks healthy deciduous trees such as maple, birch, beech and other hardwood species. Within a few years, the ALB causes the affected trees to die off. According to Röösli, the pest also affects fruit trees. "Due to its broad spectrum of effects, it is particularly feared." The pest problem started on Friday a week ago. There, a man from Zell sent in a picture via the canton's registration form. "He had seen something fly to the compost at another time and then caught the animal," said Röösli. The image comparison with the object then showed that the animals are not identical - and that both are an ALB. The canton, in cooperation with the federal government, is currently looking for the sources of infestation in order to divide the areas into appropriate zones. Sniffer dogs and arborists are used. «Once an infested tree is identified, it must be eliminated immediately», So Röösli. One is also dependent on the population, every report helps the authorities. In order to raise awareness among the residents, there was an information event for the population on Tuesday evening. This after 900 households had already been informed by letter on Friday. The ALB will keep Zell busy for at least another four years, because: until the green light is given, affected areas must be considered bug-free for four years in a row. "We are at the beginning of a marathon," emphasized Bruno Röösli. Why this long-distance run is necessary at all is difficult to say. "The beetle's main route to Europe is primarily via wooden packaging material," explained Joana Meyer from the Forest Protection and Forest Health Section of the Bafu. The federal government covers 40 percent of the costs for combating the virus, and the canton of Lucerne is responsible for the rest. Cases from earlier years from Winterthur or Marly (FR) show: The costs are between 300,000 and 3 million francs. Urs Felder, protection forest officer for the canton of Lucerne, emphasized the importance of the measures: "We must immediately eradicate all infested host plants." One is dependent on help from the population, for example by letting the arborists on private property. And: "It can be assumed that we will also have to remove trees as a preventative measure." The preventive measures still have time, however, since the beetle is active in a radius of around 400 to 500 meters. In addition, there are already no exports of wood from Zell. This is an attempt to prevent the beetle from being exported along with the wood. The municipality of Zell is now setting up a disposal point for green waste, as Urs Lustenberger, Zell's building director, said. The green waste is then examined and taken directly to the incinerator.
