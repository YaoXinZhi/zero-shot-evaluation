And Coldiretti returns to sound the alarm, after the latest results of the monitoring underway in Puglia: "Of the 10 diseased plants following the ninth monitoring update - the association states in a note - two infected olive trees found in Polignano a Mare are part of a new outbreak more than 250 meters from the buffer zone, as well as 1 infected olive tree in the countryside of Castellana Grotte which falls into the buffer zone but just 5 meters away from the free zone. Of the 172 infected plants identified with 2022 monitoring - insists Coldiretti Puglia - 81 fall in the containment area, 73 in the buffer zone and 18 in the free zone ". A situation that, in the face of the state of natural disaster recognized by the Ministry of Agricultural Policies from January to December 2021 for the entire provinces of Lecce and Brindisi and for the municipalities of the province of Taranto Avetrana, Carosino, Faggiano, Fragagnano, Lizzano, Manduria, Maruggio, Monteiasi, Pulsano, Roccaforzata, San Marzano di San Giuseppe, Sava, Torricella, however, stresses the association, "a more incisive containment strategy and the identification of new resources to deal with damage to the olive heritage, to the work and tourism which has reached almost 3 billion euros ".

Due to Xylella fastidiosa they have been lost 3 out of 4 olives in the province of Lecce, where the collapse of production - concludes Coldiretti Puglia. Has become incontrovertible from 2014 to today ".
