Laranja/Fundecitrus: Greening survey shows disease progression in SP and MG
Annual survey on greening disease (huanglongbing/HLB), one of the main orange groves, indicates that the average incidence rose from 22.37% in 2021 to 24.42% (approximately 48.67 million diseased trees) this year in the entire citrus belt of São Paulo and Triângulo/southwest of Minas Gerais. The study is from the Citriculture Defense Fund (Fundecitrus), which reports that this is the fifth consecutive year of growth in the incidence of the disease in the citrus belt. According to Fundecitrus, the situation requires more effort from citrus growers for more effective control. In the regions of Brotas, Limeira and Porto Ferreira, where the incidence was already high in previous years, greening increased to even more worrying levels, with 49.41%, 70.72% and 74.05% respectively. "We are seeing the disease grow at a speed that is worrying. However, at the same time, the results obtained in properties in regions that have registered a decline or stabilization of the disease reinforce our confidence that the measures to combat greening are effective. This has always been the way and always will be, until we manage to reach plants resistant to the disease. However, we need more efforts", informed in a note the general manager of Fundecitrus, Juliano Ayres. In the regions of Avaré and Duartina, the incidences are above the belt average, with 31.80% and 25.37%, respectively. However, a reduction in disease progress was observed in these two regions compared to previous years. In the regions of Altinópolis and Bebedouro, the observed incidences are still below the belt average, with 15.96% and 7.43%, respectively. The negative point was the significant increase in the incidence in the regions of São José do Rio Preto (from 5.32% to 14.50%) and Itapetininga (from 4.25% to 7.15%), regions that had low incidences in the previous years. Positively, in the region of Matão, the incidence has been decreasing in the last six years (8.90%) and in the regions of Triângulo Mineiro and Votuporanga, the incidences remain very low (less than 0.1%). According to the survey, several structural and conjunctural aspects contributed to the increase in the spread of greening. In most regions, in addition to the favorable climate, there is a high density of orchards and a large number of medium and small properties, making it difficult to coordinate joint actions for the regional management of the disease. Furthermore, the most important thing is that in most orchards in production, diseased trees are not being eliminated and the control of the psyllid (insect vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter spp. , which causes greening) has been inadequate. Inefficient spraying has also contributed to the growth of the index. "This work has not been carried out with the necessary frequency, especially during the sprouting season. Failures in spray coverage have also been observed, especially at the top of the canopy of adult trees and in dense orchards", explained Fundecitrus researcher Renato Bassanezi. Another extremely important factor that has impaired the effectiveness of psyllid control is the repetitive use of insecticides from the pyrethroid group without adequate rotation of insecticides with other modes of action. This recently led to the detection of psyllid resistance to this chemical group in some places. Cancer and CVC The Fundecitrus survey also shows an increase in the incidence of cancer in orchards. According to the study, the disease is present in 18.77% of the trees. The current index resumes the incidence of affected orchards in 2020, which was 17.26%. The disease accounts for 0.21% of fruit drops accounted for across the belt. The low rate is related to studies carried out by Fundecitrus that adjust the use of copper in the management of the disease, without affecting the effectiveness of the treatment and generating savings of 56% in the amount of product per hectare. The incidence of CVC remains low throughout the citrus industry, with an incidence of 0.80% in 2022, according to the survey. About 20 years ago, the disease was present in 46% of the trees. The significant reduction is mainly due to the evolution of research and management practices disseminated by Fundecitrus.
