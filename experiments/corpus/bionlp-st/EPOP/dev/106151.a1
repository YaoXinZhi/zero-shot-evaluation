T1	h1 0 116	Global genomic analysis reveals the genetic origin and secondary invasion of fall armyworm in the Eastern hemisphere
T2	p 117 1541	The major plant pest fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is native to the Americas and has colonized African and Asian countries in the Eastern hemisphere since 2016, causing severe damage to multiple agricultural crop species. However, the genetic origin of these invasive populations require more in-depth exploration. We analyzed genetic variation across FAW genomes of 153 newly sequenced individuals from Eastern hemisphere and 127 individuals mostly originating from the Americas. The global genetic structure of FAW shows that the FAW in American has experienced deep differentiation, largely consistent with the Z-chromosomal Tpi haplotypes commonly used to differentiate corn-strain and rice-strain populations. Results indicate that the invasive Eastern hemisphere populations are different from the American ones and have relatively homogeneous population structure, consistent with the common origin and recent spreading from Africa to Asia. Our analyses suggest that north- and central American corn-strain FAW are the most likely sources of the invasion into the Eastern hemisphere. Furthermore, evidence based on genomic, transcriptomic and mitochondrial haplotype network analysis suggest that there has been an earlier independent introduction of FAW into Africa that introgressed into the recent invasive population. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.
