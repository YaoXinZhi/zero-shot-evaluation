T11	p 1854 2279	 In the first instance, the project seeks to strengthen the National Phytosanitary Protection Organizations (NPPOs), such as SENASA, through the implementation of coordinated actions at the regional and national levels, with the aim of controlling the spread of the pathogen in areas that already have been affected as Colombia and Peru; and prevent the entry of the pathogen into new territories that have not been affected.
T12	p 2279 2576	 The project also seeks to identify the main risk factors for the spread of Fusarium Tropical Race 4 in Peru, based on the pest risk analysis (environmental factors, soil, water, man, movement of plant material). The update of the risk analysis is being worked on with an international consultant.
