The National Agricultural Health Service (SENASA) carried out a drill to evaluate the effectiveness of the contingency plan they have in the face of the possible detection of Fusarium Race 4 Tropical (Foc R4T), which would seriously damage banana and plantain production. The activity was carried out in the Tumbes region, and is part of the national strategy for the prevention and control of Fusarium Race 4 Tropical that is deployed in the Peruvian territory. The international expert, Dr. Miguel Dita, Senior Scientist of the Alianza Bioversity International – CIAT, also participated in the drill; who contributed to the process of control and eradication of the focus, based on international procedures and protocols. The conference was also made up of professionals from the regions of Piura, Tumbes, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, Amazonas, San Martín, Loreto, Huánuco, Pasco, Ucayali, Junín, VRAE, Madre de Dios, Cusco and Puno; banana and plantain producing areas.

In the first instance, the project seeks to strengthen the National Phytosanitary Protection Organizations (NPPOs), such as SENASA, through the implementation of coordinated actions at the regional and national levels, with the aim of controlling the spread of the pathogen in areas that already have been affected as Colombia and Peru; and prevent the entry of the pathogen into new territories that have not been affected. The project also seeks to identify the main risk factors for the spread of Fusarium Tropical Race 4 in Peru, based on the pest risk analysis (environmental factors, soil, water, man, movement of plant material). The update of the risk analysis is being worked on with an international consultant. Integrated Actions Fusarium Race 4 Tropical is a plague that was registered last year in some banana and plantain producing areas of Sullana - Piura; Since then, the articulated work of SENASA with the banana organizations and producers has prevented their dispersion to other places of production in that region and the country. To date, work continues in a comprehensive and sustainable manner with the National Banana Board and other organizations so that producers continue to implement biosafety measures on their plots.
