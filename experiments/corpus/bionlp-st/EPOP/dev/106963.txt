&quot;Big worries&quot;
"Big worries" A first case of golden-yellow yellowing has occurred in the Burggrafenamt. In the Unterland there are plants in which almost every fifth vine shows symptoms of yellowing diseases. The yellowing diseases continue to spread. The lowlands are particularly badly affected: in Salurn, symptomatic vines were found in almost all of the inspected sites, and in one vineyard even 19% of the vines were conspicuous - from 20% the entire site must be cleared. A case with golden-yellow yellowing was also detected for the first time in the Burggrafenamt. "The spread of golden yellowing causes me great concern. We can only meet the forthcoming challenges in this regard with the help of research and appropriate advice," says Arnold Schuler, State Councilor for Agriculture. Since mid-August, trained employees have been walking through the vineyards throughout South Tyrol on behalf of the South Tyrolean Wine Consortium, in particular through vineyards with Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio as well as two- and three-year-old new plantations of all varieties and mark symptomatic vines with a yellow-black band. "This year we are concentrating equally on all wine-growing zones in South Tyrol in order to determine the spread and derive the necessary measures from it," emphasizes Hansjörg Hafner, Head of Viticulture at the South Tyrolean Advisory Board. The plant protection service and the South Tyrolean Advisory Board randomly take leaf samples from all over the country, which are taken to the Laimburg test center for laboratory analysis. Flavescence dorée, the scientific name of golden yellowing, cannot be distinguished from blackwood disease with the naked eye. “This year we are mainly bringing leaf samples from zones and plants to the laboratory that were not or not severely affected in the past. This also serves to check the distribution. In more than 15% of the samples evaluated in the laboratory, the suspicion of Flavescence dorée was confirmed," explains Raffael Peer, project manager at the South Tyrolean Advisory Service. Flavescence dorèe - Golden yellow yellowing Golden yellowing is an incurable disease of the vine that occurs worldwide. The leaves turn yellowish in white wine varieties and reddish in red wine varieties and curl up at the edges into a triangle. The shoot stays green and does not thin out, the berries die off. The first suspected case was confirmed in South Tyrol in 2016, since then the number of cases has increased and the vine disease has spread from south to north. The pathogen of the golden-yellow yellowing is the cell wall-less bacterium Flavescence dorèe phytoplasma (FDp). The main carrier is the American leafhopper, which was introduced to Europe around 70 years ago and completes its entire life cycle on the vine and transmits the disease from vine to vine, vineyard to vineyard, leading to epidemic outbreaks.
