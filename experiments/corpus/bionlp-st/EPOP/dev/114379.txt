Bacteria detected in citrus fruit in nine municipalities in the Porto Metropolitan Area
The Confederation of Farmers assures that “phytosanitary measures, such as destruction, have already been adopted”.
The bacterium 'Xylella Fastidiosa' was detected in nine more places in the Porto Metropolitan Area, mainly in citrus, and the demarcated area was extended, revealed this Monday the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal (CAP). "As a result of the confirmation of the presence of the bacterium 'Xylella Fastidiosa' in nine new locations, in the municipalities of Vila Nova de Gaia, Santa Maria da Feira, Porto and Espinho , the DGAV [General Directorate of Food and Veterinary Medicine] proceeded to update the demarcated area of the metropolitan area of Porto", pointed out, in a statement, CAP. In this sense, phytosanitary measures were adopted, such as the destruction, after a treatment "against the population of potential vector insects" , of the plants covered. So far, 60 infected plants of species such as 'acacia longifolia', 'citrus limon' and 'citrus reticulata blanco' have been identified . The identification of the subspecies of the bacteria in the samples taken from citrus is still being confirmed. At stake is a bacterium transmitted by the insect 'Philaenus spumarius' (commonly known as spittlebug), which feeds on the xylem of plants and whose cycle begins in spring. The bacterium affects a large number of ornamental plant species and also crop species such as olive, almond, vine or fig. On January 18, 2019, Portugal officially informed the European Commission of the presence of the bacterium 'Xylella fastidiosa' in lavender plants in the garden of a 'zoo' in Vila Nova de Gaia, in Porto, as told Lusa, at the time, a community source.
