T5	h2 596 622	What is plane tree canker?
T6	p 623 1001	Plane tree canker is a disease caused by a fungus, Ceratocystis platani, which exclusively affects plane trees. Originally from the United States, it was introduced to southern France and Italy during World War II. The most common hypothesis is that it was brought on contaminated wooden packaging carried by American troops. Its presence has since gradually expanded in Europe.

T8	p 1002 1180	The fungus is classified as a quarantine pest by the European Union: its introduction and dissemination are prohibited in Europe and the fight against this pathogen is mandatory.
T9	h2 1181 1223	What are the consequences of an infection?
T10	p 1224 1713	The fungus infects the roots and aerial parts of plane trees. It colonizes the raw sap-conducting vessels, limiting the feeding of the infected plane tree. The leaves of the tree turn yellow in whole branches. Infection by C. platani is also identified by darker spots on the bark, orange-brown to blue or black in color and in the form of elongated flames. The tissue under these spots is necrotic. Depending on its vigor, a contaminated plane tree can die in a few months or a few years.
T11	h2 1714 1764	Where is the disease present and how is it spread?
T12	p 1765 2074	In Europe, plane tree canker stain has been detected in Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and France. The most affected French regions are Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Corsica and New Aquitaine. Outbreaks have also been reported in Pays de la Loire and Île-de-France.
T13	p 2075 2409	The disease spreads easily along waterways. Transported directly into the water, the fungus enters through wounds in the roots, which can be caused by the passage of boats. It can also spread through the roots of trees that are in direct contact with neighboring plane trees, contaminated sawdust and poorly disinfected pruning tools.
T14	h2 2410 2441	What are the means of struggle?
T15	p 2442 2600	There is no treatment for canker stain on plane trees. The only way to eradicate the disease is to cut down and root up the infected tree before incineration.
T16	p 2601 2820	To avoid the dispersion of the canker of the plane tree, it is recommended to carefully disinfect the tools used for the maintenance of the plane trees and the tools of road works, when these works are near plane trees.
T17	p 2821 3340	In addition, certain varieties of plane trees have been selected to be more resistant to the disease and others are under development. However, the level of resistance of these varieties available today does not seem sufficient to prevent their contamination in areas where canker stain is strongly present. The selection of new varieties of more resistant plane trees remains a solution envisaged in the medium term. In the short term, replacing plane trees with other plant species seems the most accessible solution.
T18	p 3341 3644	Finally, some synthetic fungicides and beneficial microorganisms may be effective against this fungus. However, no data from studies have been identified, carried out directly on plane trees and demonstrating the ability of these control methods to slow down the development of C. platani or to kill it.
