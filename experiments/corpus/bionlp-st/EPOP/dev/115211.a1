T3	p 230 2038	 Electronic biosensors could find even a single Xylella fastidiosa bacterium quickly, before its effects are visible, allowing more effective contrast interventions to the plant disease that is destroying the olive trees in the Salento area and is also taking root in other provinces of Puglia. This is the objective of the research of the Institute for the Sustainable Protection of Plants (Cnr-Ipsp) and of the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology (Cnr-Ifn) of the National Research Council, in collaboration with the Departments of Chemistry, Pharmacy -Pharmaceutical Sciences and Physics of the University of Bari, with the contribution of Agritest. The research results were published in the journal Advanced Science. «The ultrasensitive detection of Xylella fastidiosa has so far made use of molecular detection tests, which use the DNA of the bacterium itself as a target. These analyses, however, require the use of laboratory infrastructures, together with analysis times of at least three hours. The innovative electronic platform proposed by the team of researchers from Bari would instead allow the detection of a single bacterium in just 30 minutes directly in the field», observes Luisa Torsi, ordinary analytical chemistry of the University of Bari and vice president of the Scientific Council of the Cnr, which coordinated the research. Donato Boscia, head of the Bari office of the Institute for the Sustainable Protection of Plants (Cnr-Ipsp), adds that «early detection of the bacterium and the containment measures implemented in the regional territories seem to have slowed down the bacterium's spread. And rapid and reliable tools are needed to diagnose and intervene early, trying to stop the disease, for which no cures capable of healing infected plants have so far been found».
