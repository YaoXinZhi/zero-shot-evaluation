T6	p 1332 1618	Portugal confirmed the occurrence of xylella fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa the ST2 pathotype in symptomatic Elaeagnus angustifolia plants. The ST2 pathotype of the bacterium was first identified on Union territory and is responsible for the outbreak of Pierce's disease in US grapevines.
T7	p 1619 1875	Furthermore, in June, xylella fastidiosa subsp. multiplex on Citrus sinensis plants in the demarcated area and after extensive investigation several citrus species including Citrus limon, C.paradise, C. Retoculata, and C.sinensis were found to be affected.
T8	p 1876 1983	It is emphasized that, in our country to date, the presence of xylella fastidiosa has not been established.
T9	p 1984 2434	TAAE N. MESSINIAS carries out systematic checks in the nurseries and in the shops that sell and distribute propagating material. At the same time, it is intensifying the collection of samples, in the framework of the 2022 survey program for the harmful organism xylella fastidiosa in its host plants (after relevant consultation with the Benaki Plant Pathological Institute) in order to confirm the absence of the harmful organism (detection survey).
T10	p 2435 2814	Already in previous announcements we have emphasized that Xylella (xylella fastidiosa) is a very serious phytopathogenic bacterium that affects besides the olive, many cultivated tree species such as the almond tree, citrus fruits, the grape , oleander, sycamore, myrtles, milkweed, coffee, rosemary, acacia, sorghum, alfalfa and about 550 other plant species that are its hosts.
