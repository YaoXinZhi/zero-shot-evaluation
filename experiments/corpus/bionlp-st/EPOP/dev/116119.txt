Fruit fly: a new means of control tested by professionals and individuals - Réunion la 1ère
How to eliminate the fruit fly from our orchards? The augmentorium, a new ecological tool intended for both farmers and individuals from Reunion, is being tested in Reunion. Simon and Edwige Hoareau farm a three-hectare plot of citrus fruits in Petite-Ile and the farming couple are among the first to have experimented with the augmentorium in Reunion, a kind of trap that proves to be effective against the fruit fly, including the new Bactrocera dorsalis which can lay eggs in both fruits and vegetables. "We tried it for a few years and it was impeccable, but since there weren't too many on the market either. We finally stopped", explain the Hoareau spouses. But the situation changed following the experiment carried out by the Department, the Departmental Federation of Pest Defense Groups (FDGDON) and the ADASE association. Individuals encouraged to mobilize The local authority is financing the acquisition of this new control tool for both farmers and individuals to the tune of 100,000 euros. "Individuals are not allowed to buy other means of fruit fly control, so the augmentorium is a plus for everyone" , reacts Simon Hoareau. "If we as farmers fight the fly but not individuals, when there are so many fruits in every yard, then the fly will still be there ", further argues the planter from the South. Augmentorium, instructions for use How does the augmentorium work? "It helps control fly attacks, says Clarisse Clain, Alternative Control Manager at FDGDON. The objective is to pick up the fruits stung on the ground, or on the tree, and place them inside the augmentorium.The flies are therefore trapped and die as they go, then the larvae or eggs parasitized by auxiliaries go be able to come out". The goal is thus to reduce the population of fruit flies and at the same time increase that of auxiliary insects, that is to say insects useful for the development of fruits and vegetables, such as of the micro-wasp. A model at 15 euros for individuals The augmentorium is available in two models: a first in metal of one cubic meter reserved for professionals (158 euros) and another smaller, with a capacity of 80 liters, for individuals who will not have them. to pay only 15 euros to equip yourself. This year, more than 2,000 models, all made locally as part of an integration project, will be offered for sale.
