T5	p 390 960	In June, FDACS Division of Plant Industry positively identified oriental fruit flies detected during routine trapping. Additional flies were discovered during expanded trapping activities. A quarantine was established in the St. Petersburg area that prohibited the movement of fruit, vegetables and nuts without a compliance agreement from FDACS. As of Sept. 23, the treatment of this area for oriental fruit fly was complete, and no additional detections have been made in three lifecycles of the fly. Therefore, eradication was declared, and the quarantine was lifted.

T10	p 1734 2184	This species is considered one of the most serious of the world’s fruit fly pests due to its potential economic harm. It feeds on more than 436 different fruits, vegetables and nuts, including fig, loquat, mango, orange, peach, plum, sapote, soursop, Surinam cherry, tangerine, tropical almond and guava. The fruit flies lay their eggs in host fruits and vegetables. In a few days, the eggs hatch and maggots render the fruits or vegetables inedible.
