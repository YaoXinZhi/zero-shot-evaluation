In Veracruz, sale of diseased citrus fruits without a certificate
In Veracruz there are 900 nurseries selling “potentially diseased” citrus plants, without having the Service certificate In Veracruz there are 900 nurseries selling “potentially diseased” citrus plants, without having the certificate from the National Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality Service (Senasica ), which puts at risk the production of Persian lemon, orange, tangerine and grapefruit, among others, warned the secretary of Agricultural, Rural, Fisheries and Food Development (Sedarpa) Evaristo Ovando Ramirez. About the diseases in citrus plants, said the secretary, in Veracruz there are staff from the Postgraduate College dedicated to education, research and outreach in agricultural sciences, with the purpose of knowing and managing the health of the crops. In passing, the Secretary of Agricultural Development criticized that the State Plant Health Committee is dedicated to making samples of the pests that plants have, but it doesn't give a solution. “There is a study by the Postgraduate College to see how HLB is doing in crops, which for us is a matter of nutrition. In the end, the Plant Health Committees could not cope with the health issue of the state, that is simply what happens, they spend their time sampling but they do not act”. He regretted that for 20 years, in Veracruz the plant sold in nurseries has not been regulated: “They are obliged but They are not regulated, Senasica does not act on this issue, and it is a federal obligation and it is 20 years old and they have not done it,” he indicated. He pointed out that to find a cure for plant pests, Sedarpa relies on the staff of the Postgraduate College, because the Plant Health Committee is dedicated to sampling , but that “does not mean acting and finally diseases like the one in nurseries did not give it the value of the importance of life”. He reported that in Veracruz there are only 22 nurseries certified by Senasica and they guarantee to be free of pests such as Huanglongbing (HLB), but of this total, 80 percent of the plants they sell for planting are bought by farmers in the Mexican Republic. “80 percent of the seedlings from nurseries certified by Senasica go out of state, they are not planted in Veracruz and there are 900 nurseries that are not certified and sell potentially diseased plants; They already see the HLB all the problem that is heard. I don't know what people who have nurseries that are not certified by Senasica think.” Ovando Ramírez invited the nurseries to come to Sedarpa to register them in a register and thus bring them closer to Senasica. “I invite the nurserymen to register with this register of citrus nurseries, with this register of nurseries we want the secretariat to send technicians to do a sanitary management of the plants so that the plants are potentially healthy.” Finally, he explained that a plant not certified by Senasica that goes ill, damages the rest of the crops, “you take it to the You are going to invest the land in the plant, in the hole, in the fertilization and after two years you will realize that from 15 to 25 percent of the plantations can die.”
