Citrus interceptions from third countries with pests up to September have increased by 23% compared to last year, according to information collected by the agricultural organization

Brazil goes from the 10 accumulated in 2021 at this time to the 63 of this (+530%), Argentina from 5 to 8 (+200%) and Uruguay 4 for none last year.

T16	p 1370 2022	South Africa drops in number of interceptions, but keep in mind that started the bulk of its exports in September and has suspended exports of oranges from its areas with pests, but not the others. Despite suspending these shipments, it has still accumulated 16 interceptions so far this year, 4 of them in September, "which shows once again that it does not meet its commitments&rdquor;. Of those 16 interceptions, 13 correspond to Phyllosticta citricarpa, a fungus that causes the dreaded Citrus Black Spot disease. In this sense, the Unió calls for an increase in the demands and controls at source, since detections of this fungus are skyrocketing.

T22	p 2023 2507	Due to all these circumstances and the danger they entail, the Unió requests the automatic suspension of imports from third countries that cannot guarantee the phytosanitary safety of their shipments because it is always the same countries that lead the list of interceptions. In the same way, the organization calls for the implementation of a unified refrigeration system for all imports and countries and that the community authorities have a single standardized criterion for all.
