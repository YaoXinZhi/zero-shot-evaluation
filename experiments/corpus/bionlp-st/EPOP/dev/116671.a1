T2	p 81 171	They demand the suspension of shipments from those areas that cannot guarantee food safety
T3	p 171 696	 Despite the measures applied in different areas to protect farms from pests due to the arrival of products from third countries, the arrival of fruit in unacceptable conditions once again shows data that , according to the Unió Llauradora, are "scandalous and highlight the latent risk of a lethal pest entering citrus in the European Union." Citrus interceptions from third countries with pests up to September have increased by 23% compared to last year, according to information collected by the agricultural organization

Brazil goes from the 10 accumulated in 2021 at this time to the 63 of this (+530%), Argentina from 5 to 8 (+200%) and Uruguay 4 for none last year. We could also add another associated Mercosur State such as Colombia with 3 interceptions this year compared to 1 last year.

T11	p 1117 1765	 South Africa drops in number of interceptions, but keep in mind that began in September the bulk of its exports and that it has suspended orange exports from its areas with pests, but not the others. Despite suspending these shipments, it has still accumulated 16 interceptions so far this year, 4 of them in September, "which shows once again that it does not meet its commitments." Of those 16 interceptions, 13 correspond to Phyllosticta citricarpa, a fungus that causes the dreaded Citrus Black Spot disease. In this sense, the Unió calls for an increase in the demands and controls at source, since detections of this fungus are skyrocketing.

T19	p 1765 2252	 Due to all these circumstances and the danger they entail, the Unió requests the automatic suspension of imports from third countries that cannot guarantee the phytosanitary security of their shipments because it is always the same countries that head the list of interceptions. In the same way, the organization calls for the implementation of a unified refrigeration system for all imports and countries and that the community authorities have a single standardized criterion for all.

T22	p 2271 2686	 On the other hand, the Union believes that ratifying or signing agreements by the EU, such as with Mercosur or South Africa, "is a serious mistake, since there are no in-depth or rigorous impact studies on the effects that they cause in our agricultural sector or on the consequences of the possible entry of a pest, something that we are already paying for with the Xylella or with the Cotonet from South Africa".

T28	p 2687 3245	Carles Peris, general secretary of the Union, points out that “anything that involves agreements without reciprocity in production standards or in the use of active materials, without full phytosanitary guarantees in terms of pests, without acquiring the reduction commitments set forth in the European strategy From farm to table and without ordering in terms of import periods so that they do not overlap with European productions that are not in deficit, is return to the same old mistakes that always cause a huge negative impact on the European sector”.

T32	p 3275 3655	 Peris also indicates that "with the exorbitant increase in production costs, it is necessary to take all matters related to the protection of European plant health more seriously, because the introduction of a new pest or disease would further increase the costs of these treatments and would also devalue the role of citrus as suppliers of a fruit oriented to the fresh market”.
