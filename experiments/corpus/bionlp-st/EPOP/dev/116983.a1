T6	p 237 717	Since the first discoveries were made in 2018 thanks to traps for catching males, the oriental fruit fly has never left Campania. The reporting of the insect in this region represents the first found in Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. This diptera threatens fruit and wine growing in Campania, which is particularly suffering from attacks by this insect. It is a very polyphagous species that attacks over 300 plant species and for this reason the alert level is very high.

T9	p 718 1514	Buffer zonesThe CNRPortici is monitoring the insect and its diffusion, already recorded in some orchards in the province of Naples. The fight continues through a containment plan based on the subdivision of the areas into buffer zone, or buffer zone. The areas considered most at risk have been reported and it can be seen that the province of Avellino is the one most targeted by Bactrocera Dorsalis. In the municipalities of this large area, the insect settled more easily thanks to the microclimate and around 700 specimens have been identified.The containment plan is not limited to orchards but also to general wholesale markets, warehouses storage and collective collection centers as indicated in an abstract drawn up by the regional agriculture department which defines the sites at risk.
