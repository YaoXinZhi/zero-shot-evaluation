T1	h1 0 64	New variety of Cavendish banana developed with resistance to TR4
T2	p 65 250	After many years of scientific work and trials in Israel, the Netherlands and field trials in the Philippines, researchers achieved their goal of saving the well-known Cavendish banana.
T3	p 251 657	The so-called 'Panama disease', caused by the fungus Fusarium Race 4 Tropical, Foc T4R is lethal , spreads rapidly and has caused heavy losses to banana growers around the world. For this reason, the Israeli company Rahan Meristem, with the help of its Colombian partner Luis Alberto Restrepo, president of Banarica Colombia, have developed Cavendish banana plants with complete resistance to this disease.

T6	p 658 908	As an article published by the Fresh Plaza portal highlights, after many years of scientific work and trials in Israel, the Netherlands and field tests in the Philippines, the researchers achieved their goal of saving the well-known Cavendish banana.
T7	p 909 1136	In addition to its resistance to "Panama disease", the new variety that will be commercially available at the beginning of 2024, will produce more fruit, will have early flowering and will improve the architecture of the plant.
T8	p 1137 1502	â€œThe R4T strain of Panama disease is the main focus of research in the banana sector. The fact that our technology can benefit the banana sector in several ways is a positive step towards its ultimate commercialization. We are now working with our partners at Rahan to save the Cavendish banana," says Ron Diner, Rahan's CEO, as noted in the aforementioned article.
T9	p 1503 1687	Developing the new variety Cavendish required more than seven years of scientific work, including field tests of the new variety, which proved to be fully resistant to Fusarium (T4R ).

T11	p 1688 2244	The Fresh Plaza article notes that Rahan started with random mutations in banana plants from tissue culture in Israel. They then propagated a new line of more than 10,000 Cavendish varieties. These varieties were then brought to the greenhouse experiments at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and tested for their susceptibility and resistance to TR4. Field experiments were done in the Philippines with clones selected from infected fields. And later, in 2022, the Fusiarium resistant banana variety was tested, genomically sequenced and confirmed.
