Immediately after the first observations and the assessment of the species in 2014, both the Phytosanitary Department of the Piedmont Region and that of the Lombardy Region have included this insect among the priority quarantine organisms and have consequently and coordinated an obligatory fight. The territory of both regions has been littered with thousands of traps, aimed at containment but also at monitoring the population. Together with this, a timely information campaign was also carried out, giving information on the insect, on the recommended actions to be taken and those to avoid. Despite the adequate attention and suitable initiatives, including informative ones, put in place by the bodies in charge, many citizens have drawn on generic and unsuitable information on the web without verifying the indications given by the regional phytosanitary agencies. Many have given credit to improvised experts on the subject (on the youtube platform, on facebook or interviewed by non-specialized magazines) believing the proposed solutions to be valid and miraculous. widespread, is to buy traps based on pheromone emitted by the species, placing them next to vegetable gardens and orchards. It is in fact necessary to consider that Popillia japonica is a beetle that lives and acts in aggregation and the careless positioning of an attractive trap leads to increase the presence of the insect in that specific site, increasing tenfold in number. The vegetable garden or the vineyard will therefore be heavily affected since only 20-25% of the present population will end up in the trap bag. The advice of the Piedmont and Lombardy Region, for those who intend to protect their vegetable garden or garden from this beetle in the least, is to collect it early in the morning or in the evening, that is, when the temperatures drop significantly and the insect is almost totally defenseless. In these circumstances, around 20-21 C, it drops as soon as you touch it. In this way, by equipping itself with a basin of water and soap to be placed underneath, the beetle can be easily captured by falling in large quantities. To contain the spread of Popillia japonica, natural antagonists and predators would be needed but introducing other alien species in a context already severely tested by invasions linked to the globalization phenomena of the biological community can further exacerbate the problems. Nature will probably find a new balance, but it will take time. Hens, for example, have already learned to feed on adults who have fallen to the ground, but for other animals to adapt and specialize in its predation it will take tens and tens of years, if not more.
