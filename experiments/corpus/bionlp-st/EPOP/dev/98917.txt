NVWA: do not bring plants or cuttings from abroad
The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) calls on holidaymakers not to bring plants or cuttings from other countries. These can contain diseases that can sometimes have "very serious" consequences for the agricultural sector, nature, parks and gardens in our country. The NVWA specifically mentions the xylella bacterium, which can be very harmful to a large number of plant species. Xylella fastidiosa is spread "with lightning speed" by foam cicadas, insects that are also common in the Netherlands. Humans are not at risk, but 300 plant species are. "For example, 2 million olive trees have been cut down in Italy since 2013 because of this bacterium. But blackberries, oleander and oak can also be affected," says the NVWA. Xylella already occurs in France, Spain and Portugal. Outbreak "In the event of an outbreak of Xylella fastidiosa, all plants sensitive to xylella within a radius of at least 50 meters around an infestation must be destroyed," says Marieke van Lent, NVWA crisis adviser on plant health. "And within a radius of 2.5 kilometers around an infected area, no susceptible plant may be transported for four years: the area will be quarantined."ANP Image: NVWA
