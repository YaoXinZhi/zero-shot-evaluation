Innovative rootstocks for citrus fruits in Italy - Terra e Vita
The role of rootstocks is essential to help citrus plants resist biotic and abiotic factors and achieve excellent production results
The starting point for a modern citrus cultivation, capable of guaranteeing the health of the crop and production that is significant in quantity and excellent in quality, is the careful choice of rootstock. This was stated by Alberto Continella , professor of general arboriculture and tree cultivation at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment (Di3A) of the University of Catania , at the conference on innovation in citrus growing organized in the Etnean capital by FCP Cerea and Fruit Communication with the 'Order of Agronomists and the Citrus District of Sicily. «This is demonstrated by the renewal, in recent years, of both rootstocks and varieties to cope with the presence of Tristeza throughout citrus-growing Italy and in particular in Sicily. But the renewal of citrus growing starting from rootstocks is topical worldwide and is linked to the achievement of objectives among which the prevention of various diseases that are affirming themselves in the various citrus environments stands out. In fact, there are many reasons for using rootstocks in the cultivation of citrus fruits. They play a decisive role in helping the plant both to resist biotic factors ( Phytophthora , viruses and viroids, nematodes, CTV-Citrus tristeza virus, Huanglongbing (HLB) or Citrus greening) or abiotic factors (frosts, droughts, floods, salinity, pH), and to achieve specific agronomic results (size, productivity, grafting affinity, fruit quality) ». HLB tolerant citrus rootstocks Genetic improvement programs are currently in place, especially in the United States and Spain, to evaluate new rootstocks . «They pay particular attention to the“ yellow branch disease ”or HLB - informed Continella tolerant rootstocks is, therefore, one of the most promising and interesting solutions. In the United States, several research programs have evaluated the behavior of numerous rootstocks in large plots with respect to the main cultivars cultivated there and two of them, US-942 and US-897, have shown some tolerance towards HLB. Also the University of Catania, within the European Life project "Vida for Citrus", is currently evaluating, in its experimental company, new rootstocks potentially tolerant to HLB in order to study the vegetative-productive response in the Mediterranean environment in combination with pigmented orange cultivars, not very common abroad and therefore to be evaluated carefully. The rootstocks tested in the USA have been propagated not only by seed but also by micropropagation or microtalee . These propagation methods allow to obtain numerous rootstock units in a short time and, in limiting conditions such as the inability to bring seed from the United States, due to HLB disease, they are the only way to succeed in propagating the new rootstocks. Also in Italy". -. This disease, associated with bacteria that live in the phloem of plants and are transmitted through plant material and vector insects, is the most serious in recent years, so much so that it has halved citrus growing in the United States. Individuate For Tristeza too, research focuses on rootstocks Tristeza of citrus fruits is also a disease that can be tackled with adequate rootstocks, Continella added. «In the last 12 years a research, starting from a project of the Sicily Region on the Tristeza, has made it possible to compare consolidated rootstocks with other promising ones, including some Californians, on soil characterized by pH 8.5 and 3% active limestone. A first result of the comparison tests between several rootstocks is that the Californian Bitters , followed by C35 and Carpenter, conferred on Tarocco Scirè a greater pigmentation (anthocyanin content) of both the pulp and the peel, compared to the citrange Carrizo, which was intermediate among all the rootstocks observed. However, a two-year test has shown that the environmental conditions prevail over the rootstock action, since in a hot year the pigmentation (favored by temperatures below 6 C) was very limited with all the rootstocks tested. Furthermore, from the analysis of the cumulative production of Tarocco Scirè on different rootstocks in nine years, from 2014 to 2022, it emerged that C35 is the rootstock that gave the plant the highest productivity, followed however by the Californians Furr, Bitters and Carpenter, while Carrizo was once again intermediate, with a significant difference in productivity compared to the rootstocks that precede it ». Rootstocks in combination with Mandared Finally, Continella concluded, "another test conducted by Di3A of the University of Catania with Crea - Olive growing, fruit growing and citrus growing in Acireale (Ct) on the same rootstocks in combination with Mandared ( Citrus clementina x Citrus sinensis ), has demonstrated that it was C35 and the Californian rootstocks Bitters, Carpenter and Furr that expressed the greatest productivity, understood as cumulative production (kg / plant) in five years ».
