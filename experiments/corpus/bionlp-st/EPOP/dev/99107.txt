Blanco highlights the achievements to date, with less damage than last year in plantations, private gardens and self-consumption orchards SANTANDER, 20 (EUROPE PRESS) The Department of Rural Development of the Government of Cantabria has released this year 5,154 specimens of the parasitoid 'Tamarixia dryi' in 201 citrus trees distributed in 16 municipalities to stop the expansion in the region of the African Psila, a sucking insect of sub-Saharan origin that affects lemon, orange or mandarin trees. The head of the department, Guillermo Blanco, has attended a new experimental release in Obregón (Villaescusa), where he has highlighted the good results of this project, carried out by technicians from the Agricultural Research and Training Center (CIFA) in Santillana del Mar, Middle Cudeyo, Arnuero, Torrelavega, Camargo, Alfoz de Lloredo, Santa Cruz de Bezana, Piélagos, Santander, Villaescusa, Valdáliga, Polanco, Miengo, Santoña, Bárcena de Cicero and Santa María de Cayón. This is an action promoted by the Plant Production and Health section of the Executive's Agriculture and Rural Diversification service and the objective of the experimental release of the parasitoid is to determine its adaptability to the agroclimatic conditions of the areas affected by the African Psila in the autonomous community, verify its effectiveness in controlling the expansion of this invasive species and determine the possible effect on other psyllids. After verifying with the mayor of Villaescusa, Constantino Fernández, the work of CIFA in this "important" research project, Blanco has highlighted the achievements to date. "The technicians have verified that there is less damage from Psila than last year in plantations, private gardens and self-consumption orchards, but they have also detected that the parasitoids that were released in 2021 have spent the winter and have spread to areas where they do not had been released, so an increase in the presence of the parasitoid in the short term is foreseeable," he explained. In any case, the also head of Livestock, Fisheries, Food and the Environment has assured that the conclusions that are being drawn are being "very positive", in accordance with what has been observed in other regions of the Cantabrian Coast and has reiterated that the objective of This experimental control project will be achieved in the medium-long term. Blanco thanked the neighbors for their collaboration so that the CIFA technicians, dependent on the Ministry, can use their farms and properties as "test benches" to carry out investigations that they have trusted will be successful, while the project will serve to determine the convenience or not of carrying out massive releases of this parasitoid, which has authorization as a biological control organism (OCB). Its use is justified, as he has said, by its "high specificity, its reduced environmental impact and the impossibility of controlling the expansion of this insect by means of phytosanitary treatments", as it is located mainly in orchards and private gardens, in which access it is not always possible and it is difficult to carry out a comprehensive and coordinated action. Once the release has been carried out, the project includes checking the degree of parasitization reached; the evolution of its expansion in the territory; the evaluation of the efficiency of the control of the African Psila, and the study of the possible affection of the parasitoid to other psyllids present. THE FIRST OUTBREAK TWO YEARS AGO IN MOGRO The Agriculture and Rural Diversification Service, dependent on the General Directorate of Rural Development, is carrying out this project to control and monitor the African Psila after confirming two years ago a first outbreak of this species in the town of Mogro, in the municipality of Miengo, and the subsequent expansion of the species along the coastal zone of the region. Detected in the Canary Islands in 2002 and in Galicia and northern Portugal in 2014, it is a regulated quarantine pest in the European Union that represents an important vector of the bacterium that causes Huanglongbing (HLB) or greening of trees. citrus (Greening). In order to stop the spread of this insect and eradicate its presence in Cantabria, the Ministry carries out inspections in the affected areas and their surroundings to delimit its extension. To do this, the General Directorate of Rural Development has requested the collaboration of citizens to notify the Production and Plant Health section of the Ministry of suspected presence of the pest. They also claim citizen predisposition when it comes to facilitating inspectors' access to orchards and private gardens as they are the places where the different varieties of citrus fruits that exist in Cantabria are mostly located. The Ministry makes available to citizens a contact number (942 207 807) and an email (sanidadvegetalcantabria@cantabria.es) to be able to contact the technicians of the Plant Production and Health section, recommending the use of email to facilitate the study of the information. Rural development warns that it is an insect capable of spreading the bacteria that causes citrus greening by dispersing naturally by its own flight up to a distance of 1.5 kilometers that can increase with prevailing winds. Also, through the transit of infected plant material from areas where the organism is present, which can carry eggs or nymphs over long distances.
