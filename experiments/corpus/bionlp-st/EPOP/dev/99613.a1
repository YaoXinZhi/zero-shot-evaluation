T11	p 749 1584	 Background: Insecticides are essential, although controversial tools in modern pest management. However, insecticides can slow the spread of key vector-borne plant pathogens but often lead to inconsistent results given that insecticide use is generally focused on acute toxicity under no-choice conditions. Here, we analysed the lethal (survival) and sub-lethal (feeding behaviour) effects of six commercial products (acetamiprid, deltamethrin, spinosad, sulfoxaflor, pyrethrin, and kaolin) on Philaenus spumarius, vector of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of insecticides displaying different degrees of acute toxicity against spittlebugs (highest to lowest: acetamiprid, pyrethrin and kaolin) on the transmission of X. fastidiosa by P. spumarius under both free-choice and no-choice conditions.
T12	b 749 761	 Background:
T13	p 1584 2271	 Results: Deltamethrin, acetamiprid and to a limited extent pyrethrin significantly altered the feeding behaviour of P. spumarius. However, deltamethrin and acetamiprid were highly toxic against P. spumarius, but the mortality induced by exposure to pyrethrin was limited overall. In contrast, spinosad, sulfoxaflor and kaolin did not significantly impact P. spumarius feeding behaviour or survival. Under no-choice conditions, both pyrethrin and acetamiprid reduced the X. fastidiosa inoculation rate compared to kaolin and the control. On the other hand, pyrethrin reduced transmission, but acetamiprid failed to significantly affect bacterial inoculation under free-choice conditions.

T15	p 2271 2666	 Conclusion: Pyrethrin was the only compound able to reduce X. fastidiosa transmission under both free-choice and no-choice conditions. Xylella fastidiosa management strategy exclusively based on the evaluation of insecticide acute toxicity under no-choice conditions could most likely fail to prevent, or slow down, bacterial spread.
