T5	p 343 674	 Apparently the Japanese beetle might seem a harmless insect but the damage it causes to agriculture is huge and clearly visible in our territory. In fact, popilias - popilia japonica this is its scientific name - have also been widespread in Ticino for 5 years and the cantonal phytosanitary service tries to contain their spread.

T7	p 674 1010	 The 67 traps located between Stabio and Genestrerio (where the main outbreaks are present) made it possible to capture almost one million specimens. An approximate but conspicuous figure that also includes the beetles collected individually in the pilot project involving the municipalities of Mendrisio, Stabio, Novazzano and Morcote.
T8	p 1010 1256	 "However, between Lombardy and Piedmont there is a huge outbreak - says Cristina Marazzi, head of the Ticino Phytosanitary Service - we can invest a lot of energy and we will do it but its presence nearby makes total eradication very difficult".
T9	p 1256 1379	 The overall assessment of this collection experience will be drawn up by the competent cantonal authorities in the autumn.
