A million trapped beetles Small but treacherous, popilia japonica causes damage to Ticino agriculture - The traps have wreaked havoc, but it is difficult to eradicate them Apparently the Japanese beetle might seem a harmless insect but the damage it causes to agriculture is huge and clearly visible in our territory. In fact, popilias - popilia japonica this is its scientific name - have also been widespread in Ticino for 5 years and the cantonal phytosanitary service tries to contain their spread. The 67 traps located between Stabio and Genestrerio (where the main outbreaks are present) made it possible to capture almost one million specimens. An approximate but conspicuous figure that also includes the beetles collected individually in the pilot project involving the municipalities of Mendrisio, Stabio, Novazzano and Morcote. "However, between Lombardy and Piedmont there is a huge outbreak - says Cristina Marazzi, head of the Ticino Phytosanitary Service - we can invest a lot of energy and we will do it but its presence nearby makes total eradication very difficult". The overall assessment of this collection experience will be drawn up by the competent cantonal authorities in the autumn.
