The measures adopted in the Algarve region for the eradication and intensive prospecting, carried out in the demarcated area for Xylella fastidiosa , carried out by the official services, showed that the bacterium has been eradicated, so the demarcated area of Luz de Tavira was suppressed . and Santo Estevão (municipality of Tavira), through ORDER N.º 60/G/2022 (annex). This situation will be notified in EUROPHYT, in the European Commission and other member states, noting this deletion. This measure resulted from intense work carried out by DRAP Algarve's phytosanitary inspection area, in close collaboration with DGAV and the Economic Operators – Nurseries / gardens involved. Such suppression unlocks the restriction measures that had been applied following the detection of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa , in an ornamental plant "rosemary", in July 2021, which implied strong restrictions on the production / marketing of certain species of ornamental plants and of fruit trees and severe constraints in a sector of agricultural production in the Algarve, which is so important from an economic point of view, including its strong export component, and socially in view of the employment generated.
