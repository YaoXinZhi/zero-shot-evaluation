Agro News Map registers 50 agricultural pesticides Published this Tuesday (30), Act No. 38 of the Department of Plant Health and Agricultural Inputs of the Department of Agricultural Defense, brings the record of 50 formulated agricultural pesticides. Of these, 25 are organic products, nine of which are approved for use in organic agriculture. Among the new biological products is the fungus Cordyceps javanica, which works as an alternative for the management of resistant populations of whitefly, since pathogenic fungi are among the most important natural enemies of this fly species. The product is also approved for use in organic farming. Another biological controller is the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, which has been authorized for use in a product to control Spodoptera frugiperda and Scaptocoris castanea caterpillars. Still for the control of Spodoptera frugiperda, the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae receives its first record. The nematode is still indicated for the control of fungus flies ( Bradysia matogrossensis ) and the sugarcane boll weevil ( Sphenophorus levis ). For organic agriculture, the new products offered are the parasitoid Tetrastichus howardi, the parasitoid wasp Telenomus podisi and the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae , increasing the range of options for the farmer. In the case of registered chemicals, for the first time a product formulated based on the active ingredient Espiropidion will be offered to farmers. The insecticide has been under analysis since 2018 and is recommended for the control of aphids, thrips and whiteflies in cotton, beans, soybeans and tomato crops. In addition to the registration of these new products, Brazil currently has a total of 69 low toxicity products registered in 2022. These registrations are essential to reduce market concentration and increase competition and generate fairer trade with lower production costs for Brazilian agriculture. All registered products were analyzed and approved by the bodies responsible for health, environment and agriculture, according to scientific criteria and in line with the best international practices. The frosts recorded in the second half of August in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná brought concerns to wheat growers. Although it has not yet been possible to assess the intensity of damage to crops, data show a worsening of conditions in Paraná. Regarding the harvest, it follows slowly in the state. According to Seab/Deral, only 2% of the crops in Paraná were harvested. Considering the national harvest, until August 20, the harvest had reached 4%, according to Conab data. In relation to the domestic market, in recent days, negotiations have continued in a timely manner, with low availability of wheat and with producers and buyers awaiting the intensification of the harvest, which should take place at the end of September. The National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) launched this Tuesday (30) the second public notice for the Call for the Acquisition of Carbon Credits in the Voluntary Market, in the total amount of R$ 100 million to support the decarbonization projects of the economy. . The state bank's initiative aims to support the development of a market for the commercialization of carbon bonds, in addition to encouraging quality standards for the conduct of projects. According to BNDES, carbon credits represent the non-emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the preservation of the environment. The call will include projects focused on reforestation, reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, energy (biomass and methane) and sustainable agriculture. The selection criteria involve the evaluation of the proponent, the project and the price, which can be up to R$ 25 million. The result of the public notice is expected to be announced in early November. Bearing in mind that to meet the Paris Agreement target, the voluntary carbon market would need to increase more than 15 times by the year 2023, BNDES explains that trading carbon credits is a way for companies and countries to achieve their goals of decarbonization.
