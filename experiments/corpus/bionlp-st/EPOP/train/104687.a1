T1	h1 0 156	Molecular, Histological and Histochemical Responses of Banana Cultivars Challenged with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense with Different Levels of Virulence
T2	p 157 1807	Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is the most limiting factor in the banana agribusiness worldwide. Therefore, studies regarding pathogen attack mechanisms, and especially host defense responses, in this pathosystem are of utmost importance for genetic breeding programs in the development of Foc-resistant banana cultivars. In this study, analysis at the molecular, histological and histochemical levels of the Musa spp. x Foc interaction was performed. Three Foc isolates representative of race 1 (R1), subtropical race 4 (ST4) and isolate 229A, which is a putative ST4, were inoculated in two Prata-type cultivars (Prata-Anã and BRS Platina) and one cultivar of the Cavendish type (Grand Naine). Of seven genes related to plant–pathogen interactions, five were overexpressed in ‘BRS Platina’ 12 h after inoculation (HAI) with Foc R1 and ST4 but had reduced or negative expression after inoculation with Foc 229A, according to RT–qPCR analyses. While hyphae, mycelia and spores of the Foc 229A isolate grow towards the central cylinder of the Grand Naine and Prata-Anã cultivars, culminating in the occlusion of the xylem vessels, the BRS Platina cultivar responds with increased presence of cellulose, phenolic compounds and calcium oxalate crystals, reducing colonization within 30 days after inoculation (DAI). In general, these data indicate that the cultivar BRS Platina has potential for use in banana-breeding programs focused on resistance to Foc tropical race 4 (TR4) and in aggregating information on the virulence relationships of the Foc pathogen and the defense responses of banana plants after infection.
