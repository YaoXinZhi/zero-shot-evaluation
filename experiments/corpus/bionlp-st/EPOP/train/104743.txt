The public consultation phase of the first 'Olive Land Registry' of the delimited areas affected by Xylella Fastidiosa is underway. It is the strategic tool adopted by the Council of the Puglia Region, last July, to know and evaluate the productive potential damaged by bacteriosis, through a database consisting of photo-restitutions of the olive trees present in the Salento area. The cadastre, with an information system, shows the dotting of the olive trees present in the area with a separate indication of the state of health of each plant (alive, dead and symptomatic), made on the basis of the orthophotos of the years 2013, 2016 and 2019. .
