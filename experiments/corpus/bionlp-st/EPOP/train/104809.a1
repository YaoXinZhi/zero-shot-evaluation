Thanks to this tool, which I first requested to councilor Pentassuglia, it will be possible to simplify the procedures for companies that have requested the contributions provided for in the extraordinary plan for olive regeneration, for the replanting of olive trees in an infected area and have found themselves in having to deal with numerous bureaucratic problems. The next phase, at the end of the consultation, will be the validation of the land registry thanks to which the Puglia region will have a database with the mapping of the areas damaged by bacteriosis and companies will be able to have greater peace of mind in planning ". This was declared by the vice president of the regional council Cristian Casili.
T4	p 1143 1962	 "In recent months - continues Casili - I had asked the councilor Pentassuglia to intervene to resolve the stalemate that had arisen for the companies that had applied to receive contributions for the removal of infected olive trees and replanting of species resistant to xylella. Many had reported to me the delays in the inspections by the Region, which was linked to the possibility of accessing the contributions, delays that did not allow to plan the interventions. The commitment then made by the department to resolve the issue became a reality thanks to the 'olive register' of the infected areas, which contains the information necessary to be able to proceed with the uprooting without losing the right to access the foreseen contributions. The system is already operational, now we are in the final stages ”.
