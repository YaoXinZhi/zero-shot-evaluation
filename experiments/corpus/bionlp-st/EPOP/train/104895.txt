Eastern fruit fly, councilor Caputo: regional phytosanitary crisis unit met to face the emergency Campania - â€œWe have gathered the phytosanitary crisis unit at the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture of the Region to inform the members of the phytosanitary emergency status caused by the presence of the Bactrocera dorsalis insect (Eastern fruit fly). The convening of the UdC was necessary due to the recent findings in some traps used for the monitoring network in a limited area of Campania (territory of Palma Campania). This was announced by Nicola Caputo Councilor for Agriculture of the Campania Region The organism is not dangerous for human health, - explains Nicola Caputo - but particularly harmful for the fruit and vegetable sector as it is able to attack a large number of fruits of income crops. The attention of the Campania Region is maximum since a possible settlement of the insect could strongly influence the movement of the host fruits of the insect. Pursuant to EU legislation, we have notified the European Commission of the discovery, as a kind of transit. We have also put in place various containment measures such as the collection and destruction at - 80 C of the fruits fallen to the ground or in the process of veraison from the sites where they were found in the adult B. dorsalis traps, phytosanitary treatments in the same sites ; Bait application in places at risk, intensification of the monitoring network, control of the soil under the plants where there have been findings in traps in order to search for other vital forms of the insect. .
