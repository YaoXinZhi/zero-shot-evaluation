against As in France, flavescence dorée is a real pest in Switzerland, where it first appeared in 2004, in the canton of Ticino. “The affected vines must be removed and destroyed. If an infection occurs, steps are taken to control the species of sharpshooter that is spreading the disease. Alternatives to the use of insecticides are being sought” recalls the Changins Agroscope, which, in a press release, announces that it has managed to decipher the genetic inheritance of the pathogen. The disease is caused by phytoplasmas, bacteria that lack a cell wall. In order to eradicate this disease, it is important to understand how the pathogen spreads and what happens to the affected plant. That is why Agroscope researchers have deciphered the genetic inheritance of the pathogen Candidatus phytoplasma vitis . An essential discovery “Unlike other phytoplasmas, the structure of the genetic heritage of this pathogen is stable. This is an essential discovery, because stable genetic inheritance means that weak points also behave in a stable way. So it's easier to find them and use them to kill the pathogen." they congratulate each other. They will now be able to study the function of the genes revealed by genome sequencing and understand how the pathogen eludes a plant's defenses to make it sick.
