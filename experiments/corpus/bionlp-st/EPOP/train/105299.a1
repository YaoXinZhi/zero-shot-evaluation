T3	p 168 505	It is an eastern fly alert in Campania. The tephritid Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), better known as the fruit fly, has in fact been identified in an area of the Region and could cause more than damage to crops. This is why a crisis unit has been activated and measures are being considered to be implemented to prevent its establishment.

T5	h2 505 544	 Eastern Moscow in Campania, what it is
T6	p 544 1043	 The insect, native to tropical Asia, was found in two orchards in the provinces of Naples and Salerno. Morphologically, B. dorsalis is similar to the common olive fly Bactrocera oleae although the adult measures approximately twice as large (8 mm) as the olive fly (4-5 mm). Both species have a black scutum and a yellowish scutel while in B. dorsalis alone, yellow bands called vitte are clearly visible on the sides of the pronotum and a characteristic “T” shaped spot on the back of the abdomen.
T7	p 1043 1531	 The damage, typical of fruit flies, is caused by the larvae that develop in a gregarious way in the attacked fruits, feeding on the mesocarp and causing the decay of the tissues and / or the early drop. The biotic potential of B. dorsalis is very high: at 30 C the cycle from egg to adult can last only 9 days and a female can produce up to 3000 eggs , often laid in small groups in ripe fruit, piercing the epidermis thanks to the ovipositor. of substitution, typical of the tephritids.

T9	p 1531 1994	 According to what has been reported in the literature, B. dorsalis is an extremely polyphagous Diptera, being able to attack the fruits of over 470 host plants. In addition to the typical guests of the area of origin, there are tree and herbaceous crops commonly present in our territory: Citrus sp., Malus sp., Prunus sp., Diospyros sp., Vitis sp., Pyrus sp., Various solanaceae (in particular tomato) and cucurbits (including watermelon, cucumber and pumpkin).
T10	p 1994 2570	 At the moment the insect is widely spread in over 65 countries between Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Pacific islands; the report in Campania represents the first in Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. The species could have arrived in Campania through the passive diffusion of infested plant material coming from the countries where the insect is present. In countries where it is already widespread, some populations of the oriental fruit fly have adapted to climates very similar to the Mediterranean one, fearing, therefore, its acclimatization also in our territories.

The attention of the Campania Region is maximum since a possible settlement of the insect could strongly influence the movement of the host fruits of the insect.

We have also put in place various containment measures such as the collection and destruction at - 80 C of the fruits fallen to the ground or in the process of veraison from the sites where they were found in the adult B. dorsalis traps, phytosanitary treatments in the same sites ; Bait application in places at risk, intensification of the monitoring network, control of the soil under the plants where there have been findings in traps in order to search for other vital forms of the insect.
