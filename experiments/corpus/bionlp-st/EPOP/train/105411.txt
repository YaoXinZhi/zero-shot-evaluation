Olive register of the delimited areas affected by Xylella Fastidiosa: the public consultation is underway -
(AGENPARL) - Rome, 08 September 2022 - The public consultation phase of the first “Olive Land Registry” of the delimited areas affected by Xylella Fastidiosa is underway. It is the strategic tool adopted by the Regional Council last July to know and evaluate the productive potential damaged by bacteriosis, through a database consisting of photo-restorations of the olive trees present in the Salento area. The cadastre, with an information system, shows the dotting of the olive trees present in the area with a separate indication of the state of health of each plant (alive, dead and symptomatic), made on the basis of the orthophotos of the years 2013, 2016 and 2019. "The olive cadastre - says the Regional Councilor for Agriculture -, which has been operating on the SIAN portal for months, is now open to public consultation" and can be consulted on the page https://www.sian.it/XylellaViewer/captcha .html or or by scanning the QR below. “In this way - continues the commissioner - the first phase of the process that leads to the definitive approval of the information system is completed. With a subsequent provision of the Agriculture Department, the definitive validation phase of the olive register will begin, in which landowners will be allowed to report any non-conformities. The Puglia Region will therefore have a database with a mapping of the territory that will allow to have a certified basis for assessing the productive potential damaged by the bacterium and to proceed quickly with voluntary grubbing up avoiding the risk for farmers of losing even the right to any public contributions, currently available with the 'Puglia olive regeneration plan' ".
