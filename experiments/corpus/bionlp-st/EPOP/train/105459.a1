T6	p 211 306	Magdeburg continues to fight against the spread of the Asian longhorn beetle in the Wiesenpark.
T7	p 307 681	The beetles have no natural enemies, are immune to pesticides and kill the trees. A beetle was found in one of the pheromone traps caught in May and other beetle larvae in the surrounding trees. The city therefore had to have the first poplars and willows felled within a radius of 100 meters. The felled trees were shredded and taken to an incinerator in closed containers.
