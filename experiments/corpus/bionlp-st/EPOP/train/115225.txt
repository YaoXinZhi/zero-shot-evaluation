Xylella: the infection is advancing, the alarm from Coldiretti Puglia - Ostuni News
The killer bacterium 'eats' another 42 olive trees, bringing the infected plants to 214. The worrying non-stop advance in the unscathed area continues with 6 other sick olive trees in Polignano. This is what Coldiretti Puglia says, based on the 10th monitoring The killer bacterium 'eats' another 42 olive trees, bringing the plants infected with Xylella fastidiosa to 214, while the worrying non-stop advance in the unscathed area continues with 6 other sick olive trees in Polignano. This is what Coldiretti Puglia says, on the basis of the 10th monitoring with the laboratory analyzes that have confirmed the disease on 9 olive trees in Fasano, 14 in Martina Franca and 2 in Locorotondo, all in the containment area, while there are 17 olive trees infected by Xylella in Polignano, of which 11 in the buffer zone and 6 in the free zone. To try to reverse the trend, Coldiretti and Unaprol are engaged in an attempt to save the plain of monumental olive trees from the Xylella bacterium that is destroying the Apulian olive growing, with grafts and supporting new surveillance methods, such as the task force dog lover, with the scientific support of the CNR IPSP researchers and with the logistical and organizational support of Unaprol and Coldiretti who will continue to collaborate with ENCI for dog training activities which will carry out 15 checks in the year equally divided between nurseries/gardens of ornamental and/or medicinal plants of unspecified species (5 nurseries in the infected area), nurseries/gardens of plants belonging to specified species (5 nurseries in the free area) and lots of plants imported from third countries upon their arrival at the port of Bari. Furthermore, through the Redox (Remote Early Detection of Xylella) research project, funded by the Ministry of Economic Development and coordinated by the aerospace technology (DTA), remote sensing images from aircraft acquired with hyperspectral and thermal sensors will be processed of infected plants even before the symptoms appear - concludes Coldiretti Puglia - for the early identification of Xylella outbreaks through aerial surveys and drones with hyperspectral sensors and thermal. The spread of Xylella Fastidiosa could cost billions of euros over the next 50 years in Europe, while in Italy, if the expansion of the infected area is not halted, the economic impact could grow up to 5.2 billion euros – Coldiretti Puglia insists – on the basis of the study of the prestigious American journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America) on the evaluation of the impact of Xylella fastidiosa pauca on olive growing in Italy, Greece and Spain, a study carried out in scope of the H2020 POnTE Project by a multinational team of researchers led by economists from the University of Wageningen (The Netherlands). The Xyella contagion has already caused over 21 million infected plants a massacre of olive trees - concludes Coldiretti Puglia - leaving a ghostly panorama, with over 8 thousand square kilometers of territory affected by phytopathology, equal to 40% of the regional territory.
