T3	p 316 2152	 (ANSA) - BARI, 07 OCT - Electronic biosensors could\nfind even a single Xylella fastidiosa bacterium in times\nquickly, before its effects are visible, permitting\nmore effective contrast interventions to the underlying plant disease\ndestroying the olive trees in the Salento area and is taking root\nalso in other Apulian provinces. This is the goal of\nresearch by the Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection\n(Cnr-Ipsp) and the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology\n(Cnr-Ifn) of the National Research Council, in\ncollaboration with the Departments of Chemistry, Pharmacy-Science\nof Medicine and Physics of the University of Bari, with the contribution\nby Agritest. The research results have been published\nin the journal Advanced Science."The ultrasensitive detection of Xylella fastidiosa has so far made use of molecular detection tests, which use the DNA of the bacterium itself as a target. These analyses, however, require the use of laboratory, together with analysis times of at least three hours. The innovative electronic platform proposed by the team of researchers from Bari would instead allow the detection of the single bacterium in just 30 minutes directly in the field", observes Luisa Torsi, full professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Bari and vice-president of the Scientific Council of the Cnr, which coordinated the research.Donato Boscia, head of the Bari office of the Institute for the Sustainable Protection of Plants (Cnr-Ipsp), adds that "the early detection of the bacterium and the containment measures implemented in the regional territories seem to have slowed down the spread of the bacterium, and rapid and reliable tools are needed to diagnose to intervene early trying to stop the disease, for which no cures capable of healing the infected plants have so far been found".
