Chemical control strategies rely heavily on synthetic chemical nematicides to reduce PPN population densities, but their use is being progressively restricted due to environmental and human health concerns, so alternative control methods are urgently needed. Here, we review the potential of bacterial and fungal agents to suppress the most important PPNs, namely Aphelenchoides besseyi,Bursaphelenchus xylophilus,Ditylenchus dipsaci,Globodera spp., Heterodera spp., Meloidogyne spp., Nacobbus aberrans,Pratylenchus spp., Radopholus similis,Rotylenchulus reniformis, and Xiphinema index.
]. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) recommends EU member states to regulate the following nematodes as quarantine pests: Aphelenchoides besseyi,Bursaphelenchus xylophilus,Ditylenchus dipsaci, Globodera pallida,G. rostochiensis,Heterodera glycines,Meloidogyne chitwoodi,M. enterolobii, M. fallax,M. mali,Radopholus similis, and Xiphinema rivesi [
A high reproduction rate and/or a polyphagous lifestyle are key characteristics for the successful establishment and proliferation of PPN, usually placing root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), cyst nematodes (Globodera spp. and Heterodera spp.), root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.), the burrowing nematode (R. similis), and the stem and bulb nematode (D. dipsaci) as the most damaging for agricultural crops [ 11 , 12 ]. In forestry systems, B. xylophilus is uncontestably the most devastating [13]. Chemical control with synthetic nematicides is the most effective strategy to control PPNs, but due to their broad spectrum of activity, environmental toxicity, and considerable legislative pressure to restrict them, they are progressively being phased out, and the need for alternatives is pressing [ 14 ]. The integrated pest management of PPNs should, therefore, contemplate environmentally sound and economically sustainable control measures, and biological control agents (BCAs) are good candidates. The concept of biological control is based on the idea of the direct or indirect ex- ploitation of a pathogen or parasite’s natural enemies to inhibit or reduce the incidence or severity of a disease [ 15 , 16 ]. BCAs can be of different taxonomic origins: entomopathogenic nematodes, insect parasitoids, pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses), predators, protozoa, and weed-attacking herbivores [ 16 , 17 ]. Here, we consider BCAs organisms that are capable of suppressing nematodes, either by antagonism (being able to parasitize, kill, and consume their prey, or by producing molecules that negatively affect nematodes) or by providing plant-promoting effects and enhancing plant defenses against PPNs. Microbial biocontrol agents are often found and isolated from suppressive soils [ 18 ], which are usually deﬁned as soils in which pathogens and parasites do not establish or persist, establish but cause limited or no disease, or establish and cause disease for a while, before subsiding [ 19 ]. However, a single management option rarely leads to the sustainable management of a nematode problem. Ideally, a successful nematode management strategy will involve the selection of a combination of options, provided they are applicable, appropriate, and economically viable [20]. Here, we focus on bacterial and fungal BCAs, analyzing data from 2018 to 2022, and review their potential to suppress some of the most important PPNs [ 11 , 12 ], speciﬁcally A. besseyi., B. xylophilus,D. dipsaci,Globodera and Heterodera spp., Meloidogyne spp., N. aberrans,Pratylenchus spp., R. reniformis,R. similis, and X. index. Lastly, we discuss the importance of promoting research on the biocontrol of PPNs and streamlining BCAs screening, and consider the future directions for this ﬁeld.
