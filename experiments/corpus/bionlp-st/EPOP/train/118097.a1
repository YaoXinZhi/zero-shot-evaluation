T1	h1 0 102	The African vector of the deadliest citrus pest is already spreading along the entire Portuguese coast

T3	p 192 434	CASTELLO. The Spanish citrus employers' association, the Citrus Management Committee, warns of the rapid spread along the Portuguese coast of the vector of the deadliest disease of this crop, the yellow dragon, greening or huanlongbing (HLB).
T4	p 435 1087	After the Trioza eritreae was detected for the first time in October 2021 in the Algarve, specifically in the Portuguese citrus-growing region of Aljezur, one year later this insect "It has colonized some 200 kilometers of the Portuguese Atlantic coast further south and is now less than 120 kilometers from the first plantations in Huelva, in Ayamonte," the CGC points out. With this, since it was detected in Porto in 2015, the feared psyllid has expanded without interruption along the entire coast of the neighboring country and has also colonized part of Galicia (where it was detected before, in 2014), Cantabria, Asturias and the country Basque.

T6	p 1088 1643	The irrepressible spread of the insect that carries the African strain of HLB -which is the least virulent but equally harmful- was already confirmed by the latest audit of the European Commission (EC) carried out in Portugal in November last year, points out the CGC. "In that report, beyond reassuring by ruling out the presence of the bacteria that causes the disease, it was already warned that the measures implemented by the neighboring country are insufficient to eradicate, not even to contain the Trioza," recalls the state employers' association

T8	p 1657 2449	This fact, added to the confirmation in January of the presence of the other vector of this disease in Israel – the Diaphorina citri, which has a greater capacity to adapt to Mediterranean climates and which is transmitted by the more aggressive Asian strain and the African one- "question the medium-term future of Spanish citrus farming", warns the president of the Citrus Management Committee (CGC), Inmaculada Sanfeliu.In their report, officials from the European Directorate General for Health and Food Safety already criticized the "inability of the authorities to promote immediate measures to eradicate the pest in garden host plants private, unless the owners cooperate voluntarily", as well as "the lack of knowledge about the plots where the pest is present", recalls the employer.

T11	p 2450 2884	Now, after this insect has established itself throughout the Algarve coastline, which is the country's main citrus-growing area -with some 16,000 hectares and 370,000 tons of production- but also a tourist region with a landscape where scattered residences with small orchards/gardens, "it is not difficult to intuit that the insect is advancing now -as it already did further north in Portugal- inland, towards Huelva", warn the CGC.
T12	p 2884 2915	 Israel's vector also threatens
T13	p 2916 3459	"The distance from the first Mediterranean focus of D. citri found in Israel does not make it a minor threat", remarks the employer, who argues that the The main route of entry "would be the importation of fruit from affected areas, as well as contaminated plant material." All in all, the recent verification of its presence in the Hefer Valley, in a coastal city north of Tel Aviv, proves its greater capacity for adaptation –against T.erytreae- to the Mediterranean climate, to warmer temperatures, stand out from the business organization.

T16	p 3460 4291	In addition, research from the Valencian Agricultural Research Institute (IVIA), Jaume I University and the University of Florida have proven that the rootstock on which the vast majority of orange and mandarin trees in Spain are based - the citrange reed - "It is an extremely favorable host for the development and reproduction" of the so-called Asian psyllid, the sources point out. Both in Israel now, as well as in Florida and even more so in Brazil, the latter places devastated by HLB and where this vector serves to spread the disease, the fight against the insect is based on the constant use of phytosanitary treatments with products that, in the vast majority are banned in the EU and at least serve to mitigate or slow down the damage caused by the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus bacterium, which causes the disease.

T18	p 4292 4512	In January 2022, the Hebrew country officially reported the presence of D.citri six months after confirming it (in July), since then there has been no information any official information on the evolution of this plague.

T20	p 4512 4551	 Possible disappearance of citriculture
T21	p 4552 5309	According to a study carried out by the CGC itself, which extrapolated the data on the advance of this disease in Florida, the Spanish citrus industry would be reduced by half in 7 years and could disappear in less than 15 if the HLB bacterium finally arrived . Hence, the association now insists on the need for the European Commission to strengthen border controls to the extreme -both with the port inspection of fruits and that of passengers, who can also carry infected plant material- and demands the urgent review of the community strategy regarding synthetic products which, according to the latest proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of phytosanitary products, would imply their prohibition in large areas devoted to citrus production.
T22	p 5310 6075	"Biological control, as confirmed by the results obtained by the parasitoid Tamarixia dryi in the Canary Islands or Galicia, works and obtains results against Trioza but, as the situation in Portugal shows -where it has also been released-, it is not enough. In the face of the worst disease, we need to have all the weapons available", remarks Sanfeliu.Among them , the CGC has deposited hopes in the line of investigation opened in the IVIA. The Montcada center is working with the Institute of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMCP) to obtain peptides with antibacterial activity to control HLB; in the genetic improvement of citrus varieties with resistance to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and in the editing of citrus protoplasts using CRISPR/Cas-9.

T26	p 6076 6359	Paradoxically, this revolutionary editing technique -contrary to the rest of the planet- continues to be regulated in the EU by the same restrictive regulations governing transgenics, they point out from the CGC, which demands that this regulatory framework also be reviewed urgency.
