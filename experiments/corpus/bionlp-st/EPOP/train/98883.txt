EFSA updates its Xylella fastidiosa host plant database
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has updated its database of plants hosting Xylella fastidiosa by adding a total of 11 new plants.
<p>This organization has recalled that <em>Xylella fastidiosa<\/em> is a vector-borne bacterial plant pathogen associated with serious diseases in a wide range of plants.<\/p>\r\n<p> According to the EFSA, this bacterium has a wide range of plant hosts, including many common crop and wild plants. Following a request from the European Commission, this body was asked to create and periodically update a database of host plant species.<\/p>\r\n<p>This body has highlighted that the database Data provides essential evidence to scientists and risk assessors and supports them in conducting surveillance and other phytosanitary measures, such as inspections of plants to be cultivated.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of the new host plants identified and added to the database, six species correspond to plants naturally infected by <em>multiplex<\/em> subspecies of <em>Xylella fastidiosa<\/em> in the EU (France, Italy and Portugal) and five species to plants artificially infected by different subspecies of <em>Xylella<\/em> (<em>multiplex, pauca, fastidiosa<\/em> and <em>sandyi<\/em>). No additional data was retrieved for <em>X. taiwanensis<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The total number of host plants determined with at least two different detection methods or positive with one method – sequencing or pure culture isolation – now reaches 412 plant species, 190 genera and 68 families. These figures amount to 664 plant species, 299 genera and 88 families if considered independently of the detection methods applied.<\/p>
