Prevention of HLB: Citrus seedlings that were sold under the open sky were eliminated It was in the province of Tucumán. Senasa ordered it after detecting that they were also of unknown origin, breaching the regulations. San Miguel de Tucumán - The National Service for Agrifood Health and Quality (Senasa) seized and eliminated more than 40 citrus seedlings without certified origin that were for sale to the public in the open air in the town of Los Vasquez, province of Tucumán , in breach of the Huanglongbing (HLB) prevention regulations. The measure was carried out by agents of the Regional Center NOA Sur del Senasa and the Secretary of Agriculture of the Province upon detecting the irregularity a few meters from the Mercofrut tucumano, who notified the vendors that it is prohibited to sell citrus plants on public roads in the open. . “This propagation material in that state, in the open air and without knowing the origin, is of high phytosanitary risk for the region. That is why we immediately ordered their confiscation and total destruction, following the provisions of Senasa Resolution 930/09”, explained Mario Córdoba , agent of the NOA Sur Regional Center of Senasa. “There cannot be a sale to the public of unprotected citrus plants, even if they have certification, which was not the case,” remarked the Senasa professional. With this type of procedure, among others, Senasa maintains its actions to prevent HLB, a disease that kills citrus fruits and so far has no cure. .
