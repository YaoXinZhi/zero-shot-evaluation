The director of fruit trees of the Confederation of Associations of Agricultural Producers of Venezuela (Fedeagro) , Carlos Romero reported that the production of citrus fruits has been affected due to the plague of HLB or huanglongbing , better known as yellow dragon. "In our country, due to HLB or huanglongbing (yellow dragon), practically all citrus fruits, if not 90-95%, died," Romero said, according to Fedecamaras Radio. In this sense, Carlos Romero recommended that in order to curb this plague, nurseries with bacteria control would have to be implemented in order to produce HLB-free fruit. "We are being given the situation that some nurseries are producing citrus without any control or without any control of diseases and viruses, that would be a problem for the future of our fruit and culture," he said. He also highlighted that according to information handled by the union, there are nurseries in the state of Aragua that do not comply with any type of regulation to grow citrus fruits. "The solution would be to eliminate all these nurseries that produce uncertified citrus plants or with no type of control over bacteria and viruses, because as long as we have plants that have no control, we are practically not going to have citrus cultivation, because someone who wants to developing some type of plantation is not going to be able to do it, because it will be contaminated," declared Carlos Romero.
