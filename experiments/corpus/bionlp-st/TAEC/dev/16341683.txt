Development and QTL assessment of Triticum aestivum-Aegilops tauschii introgression lines.A set of 84 bread wheat lines, each containing a single homozygous introgression of the Aegilops tauschii genome was produced in the 'Chinese Spring' background via backcrossing of the D-genome chromosome substitution lines 'Chinese Spring'/Sears's 'Synthetic 6x' with the recurrent parent and subsequent selfing. The development of the lines was accompanied by microsatellite marker assisted selection. With the exception of three telomeric regions at chromosomes 1DL, 4DL and 7DS, and a region of less than 24 cM on the chromosome arm 3DL, the genome of Ae. tauschii is fully represented in these lines. The newly developed lines were used for the discovery of morphological and agronomical quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the wild species. Fifty-two introgression lines were grown in the field and evaluated for six traits including flowering time, plant height, ear length, spikelet number, fertility and grain weight per ear. Seventeen significant QTLs were detected, Ae. tauschii contributed favourable alleles at nine loci influencing five traits. The whole set of 84 homozygous lines provides a tool for further testing the effects and stability of the detected QTLs and for the evaluation of new traits.
