T1	H2 0 226	Stacking quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Fusarium head blight resistance from non-adapted sources in an European elite spring wheat background and assessing their effects on deoxynivalenol (DON) content and disease severity.
T2	P 226 2133	Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat that reduces grain yield, grain quality and contaminates the harvest with deoxynivalenol (DON). As potent resistance sources Sumai 3 and its descendants from China and Frontana from Brazil had been analysed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. We introgressed and stacked two donor QTL from CM82036 (Sumai 3/Thornbird) located on chromosomes 3B and 5A and one donor QTL from Frontana on chromosome 3A in elite European spring wheat and estimated the effects of the three individual donor QTL and their four combinations on DON, Fusarium exoantigen content, and FHB rating adjusted to heading date. One class with the susceptible QTL alleles served as control. Each of the eight QTL classes was represented by 12-15 F(3)-derived lines tested in F(5) generation as bulked progeny possessing the respective marker alleles homozygously. Traits were evaluated in a field experiment across four locations with spray inoculation of Fusarium culmorum. All three individual donor-QTL alleles significantly reduced DON content and FHB severity compared to the marker class with no donor QTL. The only exception was the donor-QTL allele 3A that had a low, but non-significant effect on FHB severity. The highest effect had the stacked donor-QTL alleles 3B and 5A for both traits. They jointly reduced DON content by 78% and FHB rating by 55% compared to the susceptible QTL class. Analysis of Fusarium exoantigen content illustrates that lower disease severity is associated with less mycelium content in the grain. In conclusion, QTL from non-adapted sources could be verified in a genetic background of German elite spring wheat. Within the QTL classes significant (P<0.05) genotypic differences were found among the individual genotypes. An additional phenotypic selection would, therefore, be advantageous after performing a marker-based selection.
