Map-based analysis of genetic loci on chromosome 2D that affect glume tenacity and threshability, components of the free-threshing habit in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).During the domestication of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), evolutionary modifications that took place in seed dispersal mechanisms enhanced its suitability for agricultural production. One of these modifications involved the evolution of the free-threshing or hulless characteristic. In this study, we studied quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting components of the free-threshing habit (threshability and glume tenacity) on chromosome 2D in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed by the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) as well as the tenacious glumes 1 (Tg1) gene in F(2) progeny (CS/CS2D F(2)) of a cross between Chinese Spring and the 2D2 substitution line [Chinese Spring (Ae. tauschii 2D)]. In the ITMI population, two QTL affected threshability (QFt.orst-2D.1 and QFt.orst-2D.2) and their location coincided with QTL affecting glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1 and QGt.orst-2D.2). In the CS/CS2D F(2) population, the location of QTL that affected glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1), the size of a glume base scar after detachment (QGba.orst-2D), and Tg1 (12-cM interval between Xwmc112 and Xbarc168) also coincided. Map comparisons suggest that QFt-orst-2D.1, QGt.orst-2D.1, and QGba.orst-2D correspond to Tg1 whereas QFt.orst-2D.2 and QGt.orst-2D.2 appear to represent separate loci. The observation of coincident QTL for threshability and glume tenacity suggests that threshability is a function of glume adherence. In addition, the observation of the coincident locations of Tg1 and QTL for the force required to detach a glume and the size of a glume base scar after detachment suggests that Tg1's effect on both glume tenacity and threshability resides on its ability to alter the level of physical attachment of glumes to the rachilla of a spikelet.
