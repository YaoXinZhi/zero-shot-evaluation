T1	H2 0 103	Quantitative trait loci for resistance to fusarium head blight in a Chinese wheat landrace Haiyanzhong.
T2	P 103 1574	Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat causes not only significant reduction in grain yield and end-use quality, but also the contamination of the grain with mycotoxins that are detrimental to human and animal health after consumption of infected grain. Growing resistant varieties is an effective approach to minimize the FHB damage. The Chinese wheat landrace Haiyanzhong (HYZ) shows a high level of resistance to FHB. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to FHB resistance in HYZ, 136 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were developed from a cross of HYZ and Wheaton, a hard spring wheat cultivar from the USA. The RIL and their parents were evaluated for percentage of scabbed spikelets (PSS) in both greenhouse and field environments. Five QTL were detected for FHB resistance in HYZ with one major QTL on 7DL. The 7DL QTL peaked at SSR marker Xwmc121, which is flanked by the SSR markers Xcfd46 and Xwmc702. This QTL explained 20.4-22.6% of the phenotypic variance in individual greenhouse experiments and 15.9% in a field experiment. Four other minor QTL on 6BS (two QTL), 5AS and 1AS each explained less than 10% of the phenotypic variance in individual experiments. HYZ carried the favorable alleles associated with FHB resistance at the QTL on 7DL, 6BS and 5AS, and the unfavorable allele at the QTL on 1AS. The major QTL on 7D can be used to improve the FHB resistance in wheat breeding programs and add diversity to the FHB resistance gene pool.
