Mapping QTL for grain yield, yield components, and spike features in a doubled haploid population of bread wheat.A doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between the Japanese cultivar 'Fukuho-kumogi' and the Israeli wheat line 'Oligoculm' was used to map genome regions involved in the expression of grain yield, yield components, and spike features in wheat (Triticum aestivum L). A total of 371 markers (RAPD, SSR, RFLP, AFLP, and two morphological traits) were used to construct the linkage map that covered 4190 cM of wheat genome including 28 linkage groups. The results of composite interval mapping for all studied traits showed that some of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) were stable over experiments conducted in 2004 and 2005. The major QTL located in the Hair-Xpsp2999 interval on chromosome 1A controlled the expression of grains/spike (R(2) = 12.9% in 2004 and 22.4% in 2005), grain weight/spike (R(2) = 21.4% in 2004 and 15.8% in 2005), and spike number (R(2) = 15.6% in 2004 and 5.4% in 2005). The QTL for grain yield located on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D totally accounted for 27.2% and 31.7% of total variation in this trait in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Alleles inherited from 'Oligoculm' increased the length of spikes and had decreasing effects on spike number. According to the data obtained in 2005, locus Xgwm261 was associated with a highly significant spike length QTL (R(2) = 42.33%) and also the major QTL for spikelet compactness (R(2) = 26.1%).
