T1	H2 0 119	Mapping a Large Number of QTL for Durable Resistance to Stripe Rust in Winter Wheat Druchamp Using SSR and SNP Markers.
T2	P 119 1953	Winter wheat Druchamp has both high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance and all-stage resistance to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). The HTAP resistance in Druchamp is durable as the variety has been resistant in adult-plant stage since it was introduced from France to the United States in late 1940s. To map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance, an F8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from cross Druchamp Ã— Michigan Amber was phenotyped for stripe rust response in multiple years in fields under natural infection and with selected Pst races under controlled greenhouse conditions, and genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified eight HTAP resistance QTL and three all-stage resistance QTL. Among the eight HTAP resistance QTL, QYrdr.wgp-1BL.2 (explaining 2.36-31.04% variation), QYrdr.wgp-2BL (2.81-15.65%), QYrdr.wgp-5AL (2.27-17.22%) and QYrdr.wgp-5BL.2 (2.42-15.13%) were significant in all tests; and QYrdr.wgp-1BL.1 (1.94-10.19%), QYrdr.wgp-1DS (2.04-27.24%), QYrdr.wgp-3AL (1.78-13.85%) and QYrdr.wgp-6BL.2 (1.69-33.71%) were significant in some of the tests. The three all-stage resistance QTL, QYrdr.wgp-5BL.1 (5.47-36.04%), QYrdr.wgp-5DL (9.27-11.94%) and QYrdr.wgp-6BL.1 (13.07-20.36%), were detected based on reactions in the seedlings tested with certain Pst races. Among the eleven QTL detected in Druchamp, at least three (QYrdr.wgp-5DL for race-specific all-stage resistance and QYrdr.wgp-3AL and QYrdr.wgp-6BL.2 for race non-specific HTAP resistance) are new. All these QTL, especially those for durable HTAP resistance, and their closely linked molecular markers could be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance to stripe rust.
