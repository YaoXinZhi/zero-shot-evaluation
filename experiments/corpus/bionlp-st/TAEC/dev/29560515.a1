T1	H2 0 95	Characterisation and mapping of adult plant stripe rust resistance in wheat accession Aus27284.
T2	P 95 1889	A new adult plant stripe rust resistance gene, Yr80, was identified in a common wheat landrace Aus27284. Linked markers were developed and validated for their utility in marker-assisted selection. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is among the most important constraints to global wheat production. The identification and characterisation of new sources of host plant resistance enrich the gene pool and underpin deployment of resistance gene pyramids in new cultivars. Aus27284 exhibited resistance at the adult plant stage against predominant Pst pathotypes and was crossed with a susceptible genotype Avocet S. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population comprising 121 lines was developed and tested in the field at three locations in 2016 and two in 2017 crop seasons. Monogenic segregation for adult plant stripe rust response was observed among the Aus27284/Avocet S RIL population and the underlying locus was temporarily designated YrAW11. Bulked-segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K SNP wheat array placed YrAW11 in chromosome 3B. Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) primers were designed for the linked SNPs and YrAW11 was flanked by KASP_65624 and KASP_53292 (3 cM) proximally and KASP_53113 (4.9 cM) distally. A partial linkage map of the genomic region carrying YrAW11 comprised nine KASP and two SSR markers. The physical position of KASP markers in the pseudomolecule of chromosome 3B placed YrAW11 in the long arm and the location of markers gwm108 and gwm376 in the deletion bin 3BL2-0.22 supported this conclusion. As no other stripe rust resistance locus has been reported in chromosome 3BL, YrAW11 was formally designated Yr80. Marker KASP_ 53113 was polymorphic among 94% of 81 Australian wheat cultivars used for validation.
