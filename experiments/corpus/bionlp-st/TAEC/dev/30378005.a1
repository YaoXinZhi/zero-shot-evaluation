T1	H2 0 130	Study of QTLs linked to awn length and their relationships with chloroplasts under control and saline environments in bread wheat.
T2	P 130 344	Some studies in wheat showed that awns may have a useful effect on yield, especially under drought stress. Up to this time few researches has identified the awn length QTLs with different effect in salinity stress.
T3	P 344 504	The primary objective of this study was to examine the additive (a) and the epistatic (aa) QTLs involve in wheat awns length in control and saline environments.
T4	P 504 1425	A F7 RIL population consisting of 319 sister lines, derived from a cross between wheat cultivars Roshan and Falat (seri82), and the two parents were grown in two environments (control and Saline) based on an alpha lattice design with two replications in each environment. At flowering, awn length was measured for each line. For QTL analysis, the linkage map of the ''Roshan Ã— Falat'' population was used, which included 748 markers including 719 DArT, 29 simple sequenced repeats (SSRs). Additive and pleiotropic QTLs were identified. In order to reveal the relationship between the identified QTL for awns length and the role of the gene or genes that it expresses, the awns length locus location and characteristics of its related CDS, gene, UTRs, ORF, exons and Introns were studied using ensemble plant ( http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum ). Furthermore, the promoter analysis has been done using NSITE-PL.
T5	P 1425 1973	We identified 6 additive QTLs for awn length by QTL Cartographer program using single-environment phenotypical values. Also, we detected three additive and two epistatic QTLs for awn length by the QTLNetwork program using multi-environment phenotypical values. Our results showed that none of the additive and epistatic QTLs had interactions with environment. One of the additive QTLs located on chromosome 4A was co-located with QTLs for number of sterile spikelet per spike in both environment and number of seed per spike in control environment.
T6	P 1973 2261	Studies of the locus linked to the awns length QTL revealed the role of awn and its chloroplasts in grain filing during abiotic stress could be enhanced by over expression of some genes like GTP-Binding proteins which are enriched in chloroplasts encoded by genes included wPt-5730 locus.
