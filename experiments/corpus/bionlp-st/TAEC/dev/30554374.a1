T1	H2 0 109	Influence of seed priming with iron and/or zinc in the nucleolar activity and protein content of bread wheat.
T2	P 109 2209	Seed priming with iron (Fe) and/or zinc (Zn) can overcome the reduced availability of these micronutrients in soils and crops, but suitable dosages should be predetermined. Nucleolus responds to stress, such as cytotoxicity, with alterations perceivable by cytogenetic analyses. This work intends to study how seed priming with Fe and/or Zn affects the nucleolar activity in roots and the total soluble protein content in the flour of bread wheat cv. 'Jordão'. Seven priming treatments with 0 mg L -1 to 8 mg L -1 of Fe and/or Zn were performed. In all treatments, each metaphase cell presented a maximum of six nucleolar organizer regions positively stained with silver nitrate (Ag-NORs). Also, a maximum number of six nucleoli per nucleus were observed in all treatments, except in the hydroprimed seeds (used as control) that showed a maximum of five nucleoli, probably due to nucleolar fusion. Irregular interphases were frequent in treatments with the highest dosage of micronutrients (8 mg L -1 Fe and/or 8 mg L -1 Zn). The nucleolar area reduced (p < 0.001) as the number of nucleoli increased, and it was lower in treatments with a combination of Fe and Zn. However, the combinations of Fe and Zn showed the highest concentrations of total soluble protein (p ≤ 0.001). Although a reduced nucleolar area represents low ribosomal RNA gene transcription and ribosomal production, the significant increase of the number of nucleoli in the seeds primed with Fe and Zn enhanced the total soluble protein content as compared to the hydroprimed seeds (control) probably due to an increase of nucleolar surface-to-volume ratio that improved the protein synthesis. Overall, this work revealed that priming of bread wheat seeds with suited dosages of Fe and Zn can improve the nutritional value of flour, and the nucleolar number, morphology, and area can be useful biomarkers in cytotoxicity studies.
