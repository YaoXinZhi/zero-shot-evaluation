T1	H2 0 160	Dissection of Pleiotropic QTL Regions Controlling Wheat Spike Characteristics Under Different Nitrogen Treatments Using Traditional and Conditional QTL Mapping.
T2	P 160 1926	Optimal spike characteristics are critical in improving the sink capacity and yield potential of wheat even in harsh environments. However, the genetic basis of their response to nitrogen deficiency is still unclear. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for six spike-related traits, including heading date (HD), spike length (SL), spikelet number (SN), spike compactness (SC), fertile spikelet number (FSN), and sterile spikelet number (SSN), were detected under two different nitrogen (N) supplies, based on a high-density genetic linkage map constructed by PCR markers, DArTs, and Affymetrix Wheat 660 K SNP chips. A total of 157 traditional QTLand 54 conditional loci were detected by inclusive composite interval mapping, among which three completely low N-stress induced QTL for SN and FSN (qSn-1A.1, qFsn-1B, and qFsn-7D) were found to maintain the desired spikelet fertility and kernel numbers even under N deficiency through pyramiding elite alleles. Twenty-eight stable QTL showing significant differencet in QTL detection model were found and seven genomic regions (R2D, R4A, R4B, R5A, R7A, R7B, and R7D) clustered by these stable QTL were highlighted. Among them, the effect of R4B on controlling spike characteristics might be contributed from Rht-B1. R7A harboring three major stable QTL (qSn-7A.2, qSc-7A, and qFsn-7A.3) might be one of the valuable candidate regions for further genetic improvement. In addition, the R7A was found to show syntenic with R7B, indicating the possibly exsting homoeologous candidate genes in both regions. The SNP markers involved with the above highlighted regions will eventually facilitate positional cloning or marker-assisted selection for the optimal spike characteristics under various N input conditions.
