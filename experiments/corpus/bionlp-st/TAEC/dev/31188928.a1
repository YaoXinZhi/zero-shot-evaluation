T1	H2 0 110	Mapping of QTL for total spikelet number per spike on chromosome 2D in wheat using a high-density genetic map.
T2	P 110 1061	Total spikelet number per spike (TSS) is one of the key components of grain yield in wheat. Chromosome (chr.) 2D contains numerous genes that control TSS. In this study, we evaluated 138 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an F2 population of a synthetic hexaploid wheat line (SHW-L1) and a common wheat cultivar (Chuanmai 32) for TSS in six different environments. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TSS, we constructed an integrated high-density genetic map of chr. 2D containing two simple sequence repeats, 35 diversity array technology markers, and 143 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We identified three stable QTL for TSS that individually explained 9.7-19.2% of the phenotypic variation and predicted 23 putative candidate genes within the QTL mapping interval. Overall, our results provide insight into the genetic basis of TSS in synthetic hexaploid wheat that may be useful in breeding high-yielding wheat cultivars.
