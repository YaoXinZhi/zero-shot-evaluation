Deletion mapping and verification of an enhanced-grain number per spike locus from the 6PL chromosome arm of Agropyron cristatum in common wheat.An enhanced-grain number per spike locus from Agropyron cristatum 6PL was mapped onto 6PL (0.27-0.51) via deletion mapping, and its effect was further verified by evaluating a newly created translocation line. Agropyron cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) is an important wild relative of common wheat and carries many desirable yield-related traits. The wheat-A. cristatum 6P disomic addition line 4844-12 exhibited high grain number per spike (GNS), high spikelet number per spike (SNS), and high kernel number per spikelet (KNS). In this study, five A. cristatum 6P deletion lines, five wheat-A. cristatum 6P translocation lines, and genetic populations of these lines were used to map the enhanced-GNS locus from A. cristatum chromosome 6P, which were genotyped via genomic in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or molecular markers. According to the evaluation of the agronomic traits in four growing seasons (2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018), we found that the deletion lines and the translocation lines carrying the long arm of A. cristatum chromosome 6P (6PL) exhibited high GNS, SNS, and KNS, and the enhanced-GNS locus was ultimately mapped onto 6PL (0.27-0.51). To verify the localization results, we created a new translocation line WAT650a (T5BL•5BS-6PL) that carried 6PL (0.35-0.42); this line exhibited higher GNS and SNS than the recipient parent Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho). Collectively, the enhanced-GNS locus of A. cristatum 6PL can be important for improving yield traits in common wheat; the translocation lines with the enhanced-GNS locus can serve as novel and valuable germplasm resources for wheat breeding.
