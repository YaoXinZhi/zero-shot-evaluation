Genetic Variation for Protein Content and Yield-Related Traits in a Durum Population Derived From an Inter-Specific Cross Between Hexaploid and Tetraploid Wheat Cultivars.Wheat grain protein content (GPC) and yield components are complex quantitative traits influenced by a multi-factorial system consisting of both genetic and environmental factors. Although seed storage proteins represent less than 15% of mature kernels, they are crucial in determining end-use properties of wheat, as well as the nutritional value of derived products. Yield and GPC are negatively correlated, and this hampers breeding programs of commercially valuable wheat varieties. The goal of this work was the evaluation of genetic variability for quantity and composition of seed storage proteins, together with yield components [grain yield per spike (GYS) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW)] in a durum wheat population obtained by an inter-specific cross between a common wheat accession and the durum cv. Saragolla. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was conducted and closely associated markers identified on a genetic map composed of 4,366 SNP markers previously obtained in the same durum population genotyped with the 90K iSelect SNP assay. A total of 22 QTL were detected for traits related to durum wheat quality. Six genomic regions responsible for GPC control were mapped on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 4A, 4B, 5B, and 7B, with major QTL on chromosomes 2B, 4A, and 5B. Nine loci were detected for GYS: two on chromosome 5B and 7A and one on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 4A, 4B, 7B, with the strongest QTL on 2B. Eight QTL were identified for TKW, three of which located on chromosome 3A, two on 1B and one on 4B, 5A, and 5B. Only small overlapping was found among QTL for GYS, TKW, and GPC, and increasing alleles coming from both parents on different chromosomes. Good candidate genes were identified in the QTL confidence intervals for GYS and TKW.
