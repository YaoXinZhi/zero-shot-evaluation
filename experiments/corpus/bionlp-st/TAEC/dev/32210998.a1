T1	H2 0 153	Characterization of the Wheat-Psathyrostachys huashania Keng 2Ns/2D Substitution Line H139: A Novel Germplasm With Enhanced Resistance to Wheat Take-All.
T2	P 153 1300	Take-all is a devastating soil-borne disease that affects wheat production. The continuous generation of disease-resistance germplasm is an important aspect of the management of this pathogen. In this study, we characterized the wheat-Psathyrostachys huashania Keng (P. huashania)-derived progeny H139 that exhibits significantly improved resistance to wheat take-all disease compared with its susceptible parent 7182. Sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH) analyses revealed that H139 is a stable wheat-P. huashania disomic substitution line lacking wheat chromosome 2D. Expressed sequence tag-sequence tagged site (EST-STS) marker and Wheat Axiom 660K Genotyping Array analysis further revealed that H139 was a novel wheat-P. huashania 2Ns/2D substitution line. In addition, the H139 line was shown to be cytologically stable with a dwarf phenotype and increased spikelet number. These results indicate that H139, with its enhanced wheat take-all disease resistance and desirable agronomic traits, provides valuable genetic resources for wheat chromosome engineering breeding.
