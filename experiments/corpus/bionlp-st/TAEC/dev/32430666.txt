Identification and validation of stable quantitative trait loci for grain filling rate in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).We identified and validated two stable grain filling rate (GFR) quantitative trait loci (QTL) in wheat that positively influenced several yield-related traits. Among them, QGfr.sicau-7D.1 was a novel GFR QTL. The grain filling rate (GFR) plays a crucial role in determining grain yield. To advance the current understanding of the genetic characteristics underlying the GFR in common wheat, three recombinant inbred line populations were used to map and validate GFR quantitative trait loci (QTL). Using a high-density genetic linkage map, 10 GFR QTL were detected. They were located on chromosomes 2D, 4A, 4B, 5B, 6D, 7A and 7D, explained 4.99-12.62% of the phenotypic variation. Two of them, QGfr.sicau-6D and QGfr.sicau-7D.1, were detected in all four environments tested and their genetic effect was validated by closely linked kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers in different genetic backgrounds. The effects of these two GFR QTL on other yield-related traits were also estimated. QGfr.sicau-6D had a significant positive influence (p < 0.01) on thousand kernel weight, kernel width, kernel volume, and kernel surface area. QGfr.sicau-7D.1 had a significant positive influence (p < 0.01) on thousand kernel weight and kernel length. Furthermore, QGfr.sicau-7D.1 was a completely novel QTL for GFR; several genes associated with grain growth and development were predicted in its physical interval. These results will facilitate molecular marker-assisted selection of wheat with high-confidence QTL for GFR and fine mapping of genes associated with GFR, thereby contributing to yield improvement.
