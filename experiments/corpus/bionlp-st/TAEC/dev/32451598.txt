Development and validation of high-throughput and low-cost STARP assays for genes underpinning economically important traits in wheat.We developed and validated 56 gene-specific semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) markers for 46 genes of important wheat quality, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, grain yield, and adaptation-related traits for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Development of high-throughput, low-cost, gene-specific molecular markers is important for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In this study, we developed 56 gene-specific semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) markers for wheat quality, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, grain yield, and adaptation-related traits. The STARP assays were validated by (1) comparison of the assays with corresponding diagnostic STS/CAPS markers on 40 diverse wheat cultivars and (2) characterization of allelic effects based on the phenotypic and genotypic data of three segregating populations and 305 diverse wheat accessions from China and 13 other countries. The STARP assays showed the advantages of high-throughput, accuracy, flexibility, simple assay design, low operational costs, and platform compatibility. The state-of-the-art assays of this study provide a robust and reliable molecular marker toolkit for wheat breeding programs.
