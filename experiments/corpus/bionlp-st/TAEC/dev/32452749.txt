Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Adult-Plant Resistance to Stripe Rust in Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum).Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a globally devastating disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), resulting in substantial economic losses. To identify effective resistance genes, a genome-wide association study was conducted on 120 common wheat lines from different wheat-growing regions of China using the wheat 90K iSelect SNP array. Seventeen loci were identified, explaining 9.5 to 21.8% of the phenotypic variation. Most of these genes were detected in the A (seven) and B (seven) genomes, with only three in the D genome. Among them, 11 loci were colocated with known resistance genes or quantitative trait loci reported previously, whereas the other six are likely new resistance loci. Annotation of flanking sequences of significantly associated SNPs indicated the presence of three important candidate genes, including E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, F-box repeat protein, and disease resistance RPP13-like protein. This study increased our knowledge in understanding the genetic architecture for stripe rust resistance and identified wheat varieties with multiple resistance alleles, which are useful for improvement of stripe rust resistance in breeding.
