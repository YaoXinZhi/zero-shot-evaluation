T2	P 134 1683	Grain quality traits determine the classification of registered wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties. Although environmental factors and crop management practices exert a considerable influence on wheat quality traits, a significant proportion of the variance is attributed to the genetic factors. To identify the underlying genetic factors of wheat quality parameters viz., grain protein content (GPC), grain starch content (GSC), and grain hardness (GH), we evaluated 372 diverse European wheat varieties in replicated field trials in up to eight environments. We observed that all of the investigated traits hold a wide and significant genetic variation, and a significant negative correlation exists between GPC and GSC plus grain yield. Our association analyses based on 26,694 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphic markers revealed a strong quantitative genetic nature of GPC and GSC with associations on groups 2, 3, and 6 chromosomes. The identification of known Puroindoline-b gene for GH provided a positive analytic proof for our studies. We report that a locus QGpc.ipk-6A controls both GPC and GSC with opposite allelic effects. Based on wheat's reference and pan-genome sequences, the physical characterization of two loci viz., QGpc.ipk-2B and QGpc.ipk-6A facilitated the identification of the candidate genes for GPC. Furthermore, by exploiting additive and epistatic interactions of loci, we evaluated the prospects of predictive breeding for the investigated traits that suggested its efficient use in the breeding programs.
