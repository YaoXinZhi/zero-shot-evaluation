T1	H2 0 83	Adult Plant Leaf Rust Resistance in AC Taber Wheat Maps to Chromosomes 2BS and 3BS.
T2	P 83 1368	AC Taber is a hard red spring wheat cultivar that has had long-lasting resistance to the leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina. The objective of this study was to determine the chromosome location of the leaf rust resistance genes in AC Taber. The leaf rust-susceptible cultivar Thatcher was crossed with AC Taber to develop an F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The RILs and parents were evaluated for segregation of leaf rust resistance in five field plot tests and in two seedling tests to race BBBDB of P. triticina. A genetic map of the RIL population was developed using 90,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers with the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat bead array. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with significant effects for lower leaf rust severity in the field plot tests were found on chromosomes 2BS and 3BS. The same QTLs also had significant effects for lower infection type in seedlings to leaf rust race BBBDB. The gene on 2BS was the adult plant resistance gene Lr13, and the gene on 3BS mapped to the same region as the adult plant resistance gene Lr74 and other QTLs for leaf rust resistance. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR assay markers linked to the 2BS and 3BS regions were developed and should be useful for marker-based selection of these genes.
