Fine mapping and validation of a major QTL for grain weight on chromosome 5B in bread wheat.A major QTL QTgw.caas-5B for thousand grain weight in wheat was fine mapped on chromosome 5B, and TraesCS5B02G044800 was predicted to be the candidate gene. Thousand grain weight (TGW), determined by grain length and width, and is an important yield component in wheat; understanding of the underlying genes and molecular mechanisms remains limited. A stable QTL QTgw.caas-5B for TGW was identified previously in a RIL population developed from a cross between Zhongmai 871 (ZM871) and a sister line Zhongmai 895 (ZM895), and the aim of this study was to perform fine mapping and validate the genetic effect of the QTL. It was delimited to an interval of approximately 2.0 Mb flanked by markers Kasp_5B29 and Kasp_5B31 (49.6-51.6 Mb) using 12 heterozygous recombinant plants obtained by selfing a residual BC1F6 line selected from the ZM871/ZM895//ZM871 population. A candidate gene was predicted following sequencing and differential expression analyses. Marker Kasp_5B_Tgw based on a SNP in TraesCS5B02G044800, the QTgw.caas-5B candidate, was developed and validated in a diversity panel of 166 cultivars. The precise mapping of QTgw.caas-5B laid a foundation for cloning of a predicted causal gene and provides a molecular marker for improving grain yield in wheat.
