Pyramiding of Fusarium Head Blight Resistance Quantitative Trait Loci, Fhb1, Fhb4, and Fhb5, in Modern Chinese Wheat Cultivars.Wheat production is increasingly threatened by the fungal disease, Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium spp. The introduction of resistant varieties is considered to be an effective measure for containment of this disease. Mapping of FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) has promoted marker-assisted breeding for FHB resistance, which has been difficult through traditional breeding due to paucity of resistance genes and quantitative nature of the resistance. The lab of Ma previously cloned Fhb1, which inhibits FHB spread within spikes, and fine mapped Fhb4 and Fhb5, which condition resistance to initial infection of Fusarium spp., from FHB-resistant indigenous line Wangshuibai (WSB). In this study, these three QTLs were simultaneously introduced into five modern Chinese wheat cultivars or lines with different ecological adaptations through marker-assisted backcross in early generations. A total of 14 introgression lines were obtained. All these lines showed significantly improved resistance to the fungal infection and disease spread in 2-year field trials after artificial inoculation. In comparison with the respective recipient lines, the Fhb1, Fhb4, and Fhb5 pyramiding could reduce the disease severity by 95% and did not systematically affect plant height, productive tiller number, kernel number per spike, thousand grain weight, flowering time, and unit yield (without Fusarium inoculation). These results indicated the great value of FHB-resistance QTLs Fhb1, Fhb4, and Fhb5 derived from WSB, and the feasibility and effectiveness of early generation selection for FHB resistance solely based on linked molecular markers.
