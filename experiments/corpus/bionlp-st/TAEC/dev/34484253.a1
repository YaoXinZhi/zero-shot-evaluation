T1	H2 0 98	Multi-Locus Genome-Wide Association Study of Four Yield-Related Traits in Chinese Wheat Landraces.
T2	P 98 1362	Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world. Here, four yield-related traits, namely, spike length, spikelets number, tillers number, and thousand-kernel weight, were evaluated in 272 Chinese wheat landraces in multiple environments. Five multi-locus genome-wide association studies (FASTmrEMMA, ISIS EN-BLASSO, mrMLM, pKWmEB, and pLARmEB) were performed using 172,711 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify yield-related quantitative trait loci (QTL). A total of 27 robust QTL were identified by more than three models. Nine of these QTL were consistent with those in previous studies. The remaining 18 QTL may be novel. We identified a major QTL, QTkw.sicau-4B, with up to 18.78% of phenotypic variation explained. The developed kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction marker for QTkw.sicau-4B was validated in two recombinant inbred line populations with an average phenotypic difference of 16.07%. After combined homologous function annotation and expression analysis, TraesCS4B01G272300 was the most likely candidate gene for QTkw.sicau-4B. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of yield-related traits and offer valuable QTL to breed wheat cultivars via marker-assisted selection.
