Identification of a Pm4 Allele as a Powdery Mildew Resistance Gene in Wheat Line Xiaomaomai.Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most destructive foliar diseases of wheat. In this study, we combined the bulked segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-seq) and comparative genomics analysis to localize the powdery mildew resistance gene in Chinese landrace Xiaomaomai. Genetic analysis of F1 plants from a crossing of Xiaomaomai Ã— Lumai23 and the derived F2 population suggests that a single recessive gene, designated as pmXMM, confers the resistance in this germplasm. A genetic linkage map was constructed using the newly developed SNP markers and pmXMM was mapped to the distal end of chromosome 2AL. The two flanking markers 2AL15 and 2AL34 were closely linked to pmXMM at the genetic distance of 3.9 cM and 1.4 cM, respectively. Using the diagnostic primers of Pm4, we confirmed that Xiaomaomai carries a Pm4 allele and the gene function was further validated by the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). In addition, we systematically analyzed pmXMM in comparison with the other Pm4 alleles. The results suggest that pmXMM is identical to Pm4d and Pm4e at sequence level. Pm4b is also not different from Pm4c according to their genome/amino acid sequences. Only a few nucleotide variances were detected between pmXMM and Pm4a/b, which indicate the haplotype variation of the Pm4 gene.
