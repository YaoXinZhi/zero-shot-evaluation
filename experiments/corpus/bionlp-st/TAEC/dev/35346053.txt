Identification and validation of QTLs for kernel number per spike and spike length in two founder genotypes of wheat.Kernel number per spike (KNS) and spike length (SL) are important spike-related traits in wheat variety improvement. Discovering genetic loci controlling these traits is necessary to elucidate the genetic basis of wheat yield traits and is very important for marker-assisted selection breeding.In the present study, we used a recombinant inbred line population with 248 lines derived from the two founder genotypes of wheat, Bima4 and BainongAK58, to construct a high-density genetic map using wheat 55 K genotyping assay. The final genetic linkage map consists of 2356 bin markers (14,812 SNPs) representing all 21 wheat chromosomes, and the entire map spanned 4141.24 cM. A total of 7 and 18 QTLs were identified for KNS and SL, respectively, and they were distributed on 11 chromosomes. The allele effects of the flanking markers for 12 stable QTLs, including four QTLs for KNS and eight QTLs for SL, were estimated based on phenotyping data collected from 15 environments in a diverse wheat panel including 384 elite cultivars and breeding lines. The positive alleles at seven loci, namely, QKns.his-7D2-1, QKns.his-7D2-2, QSl.his-4A-1, QSl.his-5D1, QSl.his-4D2-2, QSl.his-5B and QSl.his-5A-2, significantly increased KNS or SL in the diverse panel, suggesting they are more universal in their effects and are valuable for gene pyramiding in breeding programs. The transmission of Bima4 allele indicated that the favorite alleles at five loci (QKns.his-7D2-1, QSl.his-5A-2, QSl.his-2D1-1, QSl.his-3A-2 and QSl.his-3B) showed a relatively high frequency or an upward trend following the continuity of generations, suggesting that they underwent rigorous selection during breeding. At two loci (QKns.his-7D2-1 and QSl.his-5A-2) that the positive effects of the Bima4 alleles have been validated in the diverse panel, two and one kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were further developed, respectively, and they are valuable for marker-assisted selection breeding.Important chromosome regions controlling KNS and SL were identified in the founder parents. Our results are useful for knowing the molecular mechanisms of founder parents and future molecular breeding in wheat.
