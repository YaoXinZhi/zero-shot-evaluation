T1	H2 0 82	Identification of AFLP markers on the satellite region of chromosome 1BS in wheat.
T2	P 82 1279	The satellite region on the short arm of chromosome 1B in wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) carries many agronomically important genes; i.e., genes conferring fungal disease resistance, seed storage proteins, and fertility restoration. To find molecular markers located on the satellite region, we applied the fluorescent AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) technique to aneuploids and deletion stocks of the cultivar T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring'. Out of 6017 fragments amplified with 80 primer combinations in normal 'Chinese Spring', 24 were assigned to 1BS. Twelve of them clustered within a small region of the satellite known to be rich in RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers. AFLPs in 1BS and in the whole genome were calculated between 'Chinese Spring' and T. spelta var. duhamelianum. The polymorphism rates in the satellite region (58.3%) and in the 1BS arm (45.8%) were much higher than the average rate for the whole genome (10.7%). Seven of the 12 AFLP markers in the satellite region were revealed to be specific to 'Chinese Spring' and could potentially be useful for genetic mapping in a segregation population of 'Chinese Spring' x T. spelta.
