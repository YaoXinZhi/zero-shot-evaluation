Use of SAMPL for a study of DNA polymorphism, genetic diversity and possible gene tagging in bread wheat.Selective Amplification of Microsatellite Polymorphic Loci (SAMPL) technology was used in bread wheat for the first time for a study of genetic diversity, genotype identification and gene tagging. The diversity studies involved 55 wheat genotypes and two SAMPL primer pairs (SAMPL-6 and SAMPL-7, each with a M-CAG primer), which together gave 43 polymorphic bands out of a total of 87 SAMPL bands. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) of SAMPL primers was 0.221 and that of SAMPL markers was 0.264. The marker index of SAMPL markers was 9.61. The genetic similarity (GS) coefficients for 1,485 pairs of genotypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.96 with an average of 0.65. A dendrogram was prepared on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm, which corresponded well with the results of principal component analysis (PCA). From a total of 55 genotypes, 54 could be distinguished using the SAMPL banding patterns of both primers. For gene tagging, 568 bands from a total of 1,185 SAMPL bands detected polymorphism between each of the three pairs of parents differing for grain protein content (GPC), pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (PHST) and grain weight (GW). An association of six bands with GPC, of seven bands with PHST and four bands with GW was observed using bulked segregant analysis (BSA).
