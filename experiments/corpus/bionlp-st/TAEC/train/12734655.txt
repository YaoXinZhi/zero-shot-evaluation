Mapping genes affecting flowering time and frost resistance on chromosome 5B of wheat.Two populations of single chromosome recombinant lines were used to map genes controlling flowering time on chromosome 5B of wheat, and one of the populations was also used to map a new frost resistance gene. Genetic maps were developed, mainly using microsatellite markers, and QTL analysis was applied to phenotypic data on the performance of each population collected from growth-room tests of flowering time and frost tolerance. Using a recombinant substitution-line mapping population derived from a cross between the substitution-line 'Chinese Spring' ('Cheyenne' 5B) and 'Chinese Spring' (CS), the gene Vrn-B1, affecting vernalization response, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL1, and a gene, Fr-B1, affecting frost resistance, were mapped. Using a 'Hobbit Sib' ('Chinese Spring' 5BL) x 'Hobbit Sib' recombinant substitution line mapping population, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL2 was mapped. The Vrn-B1 locus was mapped on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 5B, to a region syntenous with the segments of chromosomes 5A and 5D containing Vrn-A1 and Vrn-D1 loci, respectively. The two Eps-5BL loci were mapped close to the centromere with a 16-cM distance from each other, one in agreement with the position of a homoeologous locus previously mapped on chromosome 5H of barley, and suggested by the response of 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines. The Fr-B1 gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B, 40 cM from the centromeric marker. Previous comparative mapping data with rice chromosome 9 would suggest that this gene could be orthologous to the other Fr genes mapped previously by us on chromosomes 5A or 5D of wheat, although in a more proximal position. This study completes the mapping of these homoeoallelic series of vernalization requirement genes and frost resistance genes on the chromosomes of the homoeologous group 5 in wheat.
