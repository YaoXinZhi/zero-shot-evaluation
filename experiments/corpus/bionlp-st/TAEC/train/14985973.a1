T1	H2 0 68	Identification of Canadian durum wheat varieties using a single PCR.
T2	P 68 1038	Accurate and reliable means of variety identification are necessary to assess purity of seed supplies, to support claims relating to plant breeders' rights and, in Canada, to provide quality assurances in the grain handling system. A single, multiplexed set of seven simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) markers was found to uniquely identify all 18 durum wheat varieties that have been developed in Canada and are currently, or were formerly, registered for commercial production. Significant features of this multiplexed set include an allele that is specific, within Canadian durum varieties, to those having high gluten strength, and redundancy that was included in an effort to increase the capacity to accommodate future varieties. In combination with a reasonably rapid individual-kernel DNA extraction protocol and automated allele calling, this marker system offers a higher resolution alternative to complement established protein-based variety identification methods.
