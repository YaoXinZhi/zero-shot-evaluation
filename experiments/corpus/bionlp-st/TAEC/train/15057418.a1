T1	H2 0 69	Haplotype diversity at fusarium head blight resistance QTLs in wheat.
T2	P 69 1265	Fusarium head blight (FHB) reduces grain yield and quality in common and durum wheat. Host FHB resistance is an effective control measure that is achieved by stacking multiple resistance genes into a wheat line. Therefore, breeders would benefit from knowing which resistance sources carry different resistance genes. A diverse collection of FHB-resistant and -susceptible wheat lines was characterized with microsatellite markers linked to FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 2DL, 3BS (distal to the centromere), 3BSc (proximal to the centromere), 4B, 5AS and 6BS identified in wheat lines Maringa, Sumai 3 and Wuhan 1. Putative Sumai 3 QTLs were commonly observed in advanced breeding lines, whereas putative Maringa and Wuhan 1 QTLs were relatively rare. Marker data suggested the 3BS, 3BSc and 5AS QTLs in the Brazilian cv. Maringa were derived from Asian germplasm and not from Frontana or other Brazilian lines. Haplotype diversity was reduced near the 5AS QTL, which might impact the deployment of this QTL. Finally, Brazilian germplasm was not closely related to other resistance sources and might be useful for pyramiding with Asian wheat-derived FHB resistance.
