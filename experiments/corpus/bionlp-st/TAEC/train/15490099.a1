T1	H2 0 105	Molecular mapping of Stb1, a potentially durable gene for resistance to septoria tritici blotch in wheat.
T2	P 105 2560	Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), was the most destructive disease of wheat in Indiana and adjacent states before deployment of the resistance gene Stb1 during the early 1970s. Since then, Stb1 has provided durable protection against STB in widely grown wheat cultivars. However, its chromosomal location and allelic relationships to most other STB genes are not known, so the molecular mapping of Stb1 is of great interest. Genetic analyses and molecular mapping were performed for two mapping populations. A total of 148 F1 plants (mapping population I) were derived from a three-way cross between the resistant line P881072-75-1 and the susceptible lines P881072-75-2 and Monon, and 106 F6 recombinant-inbred lines (mapping population II) were developed from a cross between the resistant line 72626E2-12-9-1 and the susceptible cultivar Arthur. Bulked-segregant analysis with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers was conducted to identify those that were putatively linked to the Stb1 gene. Segregation analyses confirmed that a single dominant gene controls the resistance to M. graminicola in each mapping population. Two RAPD markers, G7(1200) and H19(520), were tightly linked to Stb1 in wheat line P881072-75-1 at distances of less than 0.68 cM and 1.4 cM, respectively. In mapping population II, the most closely linked marker was SSR Xbarc74, which was 2.8 cM proximal to Stb1 on chromosome 5BL. Microsatellite loci Xgwm335 and Xgwm213 also were proximal to Stb1 at distances of 7.4 cM and 8.3 cM, respectively. The flanking AFLP marker, EcoRI-AGC/ MseI-CTA-1, was 8.4 cM distal to Stb1. The two RAPD markers, G7(1200) and H19(520), and AFLP EcoRI-AGC/ MseI-CTA-1, were cloned and sequenced for conversion into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Only RAPD allele H19(520) could be converted successfully, and none of the SCAR markers was diagnostic for the Stb1 locus. Analysis of SSR and the original RAPD primers on several 5BL deletion stocks positioned the Stb1 locus in the region delineated by chromosome breakpoints at fraction lengths 0.59 and 0.75. The molecular markers tightly linked to Stb1 could be useful for marker-assisted selection and for pyramiding of Stb1 with other genes for resistance to M. graminicola in wheat.
