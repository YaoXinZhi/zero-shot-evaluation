T1	H2 0 137	Microsatellite markers linked to 2 powdery mildew resistance genes introgressed from Triticum carthlicum accession PS5 into common wheat.
T2	P 137 1100	Two dominant powdery mildew resistance genes introduced from Triticum carthlicum accession PS5 to common wheat were identified and tagged using microsatellite markers. The gene designated PmPS5A was placed on wheat chromosome 2AL and linked to the microsatellite marker Xgwm356 at a genetic distance of 10.2 cM. Based on the information of its origin, chromosome location, and reactions to 5 powdery mildew isolates, this gene could be a member of the complex Pm4 locus. The 2nd gene designated PmPS5B was located on wheat chromosome 2BL with 3 microsatellite markers mapping proximally to the gene: Xwmc317 at 1.1 cM; Xgwm111 at 2.2 cM; and Xgwm382 at 4.0 cM; and 1 marker, Xgwm526, mapping distally to the gene at a distance of 18.1 cM. Since this gene showed no linkage to the other 2 known powdery mildew resistance genes on wheat chromosome 2B, Pm6 and Pm26, we believe it is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene and propose to designate this gene as Pm33.
