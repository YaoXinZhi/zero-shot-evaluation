T1	H2 0 128	Mapping QTL associated with resistance to Fusarium head blight in the Nanda2419 x Wangshuibai population. II: type I resistance.
T2	P 128 1751	Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a serious disease in wheat and barley affecting both yield and quality. To identify genes for resistance to infection, the RIL population derived from 'Nanda2419' x 'Wangshuibai' and the parents were evaluated for percentage of infected spikes (PIS) in four different environments. Using a 2,960 cM marker framework map constructed for this population, ten chromosome regions were detected for their association with type I resistance through interval mapping with Mapmaker/QTL, among which QTLs mapped in the intervals of Xwmc349--Xgwm149 on chromosome 4B, of Xwmc96--Xgwm304 on chromosome 5A and of Xgwm408--Xbarc140 on chromosome 5B were revealed in at least three environments and have Wangshuibai as the source of resistance alleles. Qfhi.nau-4B and Qfhi.nau-5A had larger effects and explained up to 17.5 and 27.0% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. To detect epistasis QTLs, two-locus interactions were examined by whole genome scan. Interactions of five locus pairs were found to have significant effects on type I resistance with the LOD score ranging 3.8-6.5 and four of them conferred resistance in parental phase. The one with the most significant effect was Xcfd42--Xgwm469 (6D)/Xwmc390-2--Xbd04 (2A) pair. No QTL x E interaction was detected for PIS. It was found that flowering time did not have significant effects on PIS in this population. Our studies indicated that Wangshuibai is useful for breeding for both type I and type II scab resistance and the markers associated with the QTLs could be used in marker-assisted selection and isolation of scab-resistance QTLs.
