T1	H2 0 119	Physical map of the wheat high-grain protein content gene Gpc-B1 and development of a high-throughput molecular marker.
T2	P 119 1357	Grain protein content (GPC) is important for human nutrition and has a strong influence on pasta and bread quality. A quantitative trait locus, derived from a Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides accession (DIC), with an average increase in GPC of 14 g kg(-1) was mapped on chromosome 6BS. Using the wheat-rice colinearity, a high-density map of the wheat region was developed and the quantitative trait locus was mapped as a simple Mendelian locus designated Gpc-B1. A physical map of approx. 250 kb of the Gpc-B1 region was developed using a tetraploid wheat bacterial artificial chromosome library. The constructed physical map included the two Gpc-B1 flanking markers and one potential candidate gene from the colinear rice region completely linked to Gpc-B1. The relationship between physical and genetic distances and the feasibility of isolating genes by positional cloning in wheat are discussed. A high-throughput codominant marker, Xuhw89, was developed. A 4-bp deletion present in the DIC allele was absent in a collection of 117 cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat germplasm, suggesting that this marker will be useful to incorporate the high GPC allele from the DIC accession studied here into commercial wheat varieties.
