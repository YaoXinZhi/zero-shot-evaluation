Marker-assisted characterization of Asian wheat lines for resistance to Fusarium head blight.The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on 3BS from Sumai 3 and its derivatives has been used as a major source of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) worldwide, but resistance genes from other sources are necessary to avoid complete dependence on a single source of resistance. Fifty-nine Asian wheat landraces and cultivars differing in the levels of FHB resistance were evaluated for type II FHB resistance and for genetic diversity on the basis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genetic relationships among these wheat accessions estimated by cluster analysis of molecular marker data were consistent with their geographic distribution and pedigrees. Chinese resistant landraces had broader genetic diversity than that of accessions from southwestern Japan. The haplotype pattern of the SSR markers that linked to FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 3BS, 5AS and 6BS of Sumai 3 suggested that only a few lines derived from Sumai 3 may carry all the putative QTLs from Sumai 3. About half of the accessions might have one or two FHB resistance QTLs from Sumai 3. Some accessions with a high level of resistance, may carry different FHB resistance loci or alleles from those in Sumai 3, and are worth further investigation. SSR data also clearly suggested that FHB resistance QTLs on 3BS, 5AS, and 6BS of Sumai 3 were derived from Chinese landrace Taiwan Xiaomai.
