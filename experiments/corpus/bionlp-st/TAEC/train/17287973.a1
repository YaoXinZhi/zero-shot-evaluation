T1	H2 0 120	Negative effect of chromosome 1A on dough strength shown by modification of 1D addition in durum wheat (Triticum durum).
T2	P 120 2154	A monosomic addition line of Aegilops tauschii chromosome 1D in Triticum durum cv. PBW114 was produced in 1990. This line was self-pollinated and maintained for several generations while following the presence of chromosome 1D carrying the gene for red glume color. Cytological analysis indicated that two of the three derivative lines had substitution of chromosome 1D for 1A and another had substitution of chromosome 1D for 1B. One of these lines carried a pair of small chromosomes in addition to the 1D chromosome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the derived lines showed the presence of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin encoded by the Glu-D1 locus. The small chromosome found in one of the lines had nearly regular pairing and transmission to daughter nuclei. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and analysis of molecular markers indicated that the small chromosome was derived from the short arm of chromosome 1A and carried the Glu-A3 locus. Microsatellite mapping based on the deletion bin map revealed that the small chromosome had terminal deletions on both the terminal and centromeric sides. The line with the small chromosome showed improvement of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sedimentation value as compared to parent durum. However, the increase in SDS-sedimentation value was more significant in the substitution line of chromosome 1D for 1A without the small chromosome. These facts suggest a negative effect of the Glu-A3 locus on dough strength. The sequence of the Glu-D1 locus from these lines showed that the HMW glutenin subunits were Ae. tauschii specific 2(t) + T2, which were previously found to be associated with poor rheological properties and bread loaf volume in synthetic hexaploid wheat by other workers. Thus, the significant improvement in the SDS-sedimentation value of the substitution line of 1D for 1A suggests that the absence of the negative effect of chromosome 1A on quality is more important than the presence of Glu-D1 of Ae. tauschii.
