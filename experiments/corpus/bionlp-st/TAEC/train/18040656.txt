FT genome A and D polymorphisms are associated with the variation of earliness components in hexaploid wheat.The transition from vegetative to floral meristems in higher plants is determined by the coincidence of internal and environmental signals. Contrary to the photoperiod pathway, convergent evolution of the cold-dependent pathway has implicated different genes between dicots and monocots. Whereas no association between natural variation in vernalization requirement and Flowering time locus T (FT) gene polymorphism has been described in Arabidopsis, recent studies in Triticeae suggest implication of orthologous copies of FT in the cold response. In our study, we show that nucleotide polymorphisms on A and D copies of the wheat FT gene were associated with variations for heading date in a collection of 239 lines representing diverse geographical origins and status (landraces, old or recent cultivars). Interestingly, polymorphisms in the non-coding intronic region were strongly associated to flowering variation observed on plants grown without vernalization. But differently from VRN1, no epistatic interaction between FT homeologous copies was revealed. In agreement with the results of association study, the A and D copies of FT were mapped in regions including major QTLs for earliness traits in hexaploid wheat. This work, by identifying additional homeoalleles involved in wheat vernalization pathway, will contribute to a better understanding of the control of flowering, hence providing tools for the breeding of varieties with enhanced adaptation to changing environments.
