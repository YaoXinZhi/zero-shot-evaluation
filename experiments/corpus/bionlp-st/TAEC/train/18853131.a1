T1	H2 0 127	QTL mapping for grain filling rate and yield-related traits in RILs of the Chinese winter wheat population Heshangmai x Yu8679.
T2	P 127 1595	A set of 142 winter wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs) deriving from the cross Heshangmai x Yu8679 were tried in four ecological environments during the seasons 2006 and 2007. Nine agronomic traits comprising mean grain filling rate (GFR(mean)), maximum grain filling rate (GFR(max)), grain filling duration (GFD), grain number per ear (GNE), grain weight per ear (GWE), flowering time (FT), maturation time (MT), plant height (PHT) and thousand grain weight (TGW) were evaluated in Beijing (2006 and 2007), Chengdu (2007) and Hefei (2007). A genetic map comprising 173 SSR markers and two EST markers was generated. Based on the genetic map and phenotypic data, quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for these agronomic traits. A total of 99 putative QTLs were identified for the nine traits over four environments except GFD, PHT and MT, measured in two environments (BJ07 and CD07), respectively. Of the QTL detected, 17 for GFR(mean), 16 for GFR(max), 21 for TGW and 10 for GWE involving the chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2D, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6D and 7D were identified. Moreover, 13 genomic regions showing pleiotropic effects were detected in chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4B, 4D, 5B, 6D and 7D; these QTL revealing pleiotropic effects may be informative for a better understanding of the genetic basis of grain filling rate and other yield-related traits, and represent potential targets for multi-trait marker aided selection in wheat.
