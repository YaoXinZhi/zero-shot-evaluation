T1	H2 0 127	Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers linked to a major quantitative trait locus controlling scab resistance in wheat.
T2	P 127 1951	ABSTRACT Scab is a destructive disease of wheat. To accelerate development of scab-resistant wheat cultivars, molecular markers linked to scab resistance genes have been identified by using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived by single-seed descent from a cross between the resistant wheat cultivar Ning 7840 (resistant to spread of scab within the spike) and the susceptible cultivar Clark. In the greenhouse, F(5), F(6), F(7), and F(10) families were evaluated for resistance to spread of scab within a spike by injecting about 1,000 conidiospores of Fusarium graminearum into a central spikelet. Inoculated plants were kept in moist chambers for 3 days to promote initial infection and then transferred to greenhouse benches. Scab symptoms were evaluated four times (3, 9, 15, and 21 days after inoculation). The frequency distribution of scab severity indicated that resistance to spread of scab within a spike was controlled by a few major genes. DNA was isolated from both parents and F(9) plants of the 133 RILs. A total of 300 combinations of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers were screened for polymorphisms using bulked segregant analysis. Twenty pairs of primers revealed at least one polymorphic band between the two contrasting bulks. The segregation of each of these bands was evaluated in the 133 RILs. Eleven AFLP markers showed significant association with scab resistance, and an individual marker explained up to 53% of the total variation (R(2)). The markers with high R(2) values mapped to a single linkage group. By interval analysis, one major quantitative trait locus for scab resistance explaining up to 60% of the genetic variation for scab resistance was identified. Some of the AFLP markers may be useful in marker-assisted breeding to improve resistance to scab in wheat.
