T1	H2 0 128	Mapping of main and epistatic effect QTLs associated to grain protein and gluten strength using a RIL population of durum wheat.
T2	P 128 1733	Quality, specifically protein content and gluten strength are among the main objectives of a durum wheat breeding program. The aim of this work was to validate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with grain protein content (GPC) and gluten strength measured by SDS sedimentation volume (SV) and to find additional QTLs expressed in Argentinean environments. Also, epistatic QTL and QTL x environmental interactions were analyzed. A mapping population of 93 RILs derived from the cross UC1113 x Kofa showing extreme values in gluten quality was used. Phenotypic data were collected along six environments (three locations, two years). Main effect QTLs associated with GPC were found in equivalent positions in two environments on chromosomes 3BS (R(2)=21.0-21.6%) and 7BL (R(2)=12.1-13%), and in one environment on chromosomes 1BS, 2AL, 2BS, 3BL, 4AL, 5AS, 5BL and 7AS. The most important and stable QTL affecting SV was located on chromosome 1BL (Glu-B1) consistently detected over the six environments (R(2)=20.9- 54.2%). Additional QTLs were found in three environments on chromosomes 6AL (R(2)=6.4-12.5%), and in two environments on chromosomes 6BL (R(2)=11.5-12.1%), 7AS (R(2)=8.2-10.2%) and 4BS (R(2)=11-16.4%). In addition, pleiotropic effects were found affecting grain yield, test weight, thousand-kernel-weight and days to heading in some of these QTLs. Epistatic QTLs and QTL x environment interactions were found for both quality traits, mostly for GPC. The flanking markers of the QTLs detected in this work could be efficient tools to select superior genotypes for the mentioned traits.
