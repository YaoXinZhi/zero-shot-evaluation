The location of major genes and associated quantitative trait loci on chromosome arm 5BL of wheat.Chromosome 5B of bread wheat is known to carry two major genes giving rise to genetic disorders, Ne1 for hybrid necrosis and Vg for winter variegation. Additionally, in many european winter wheat varieties this chromosome is represented in a translocated form, with 5BL-7BL, 5BL-7BS chromosomes rather than the normal 5B and 7B forms of the standard variety Chinese Spring. Genetic analysis has been carried out to map these genes and the translocation break point, and to investigate their pleiotropic effects or those of linked quantitative trait loci (qtl) for economically important characters. This was facilitated by the development of single chromosome recombinant lines between a normal and translocated karyotype, and growing these in field experiments over two seasons. There was differential segregation in favour of the translocated karyotype in the population of recombinant lines. Linkage analysis revealed that the two morphological markers and the isozyme locus Ibf-B1 were located on the long arm of 5B with a gene order of: breakpoint - Ne1 - Vg - Ibf-B1. Analysis of quantitative characters using these genes as landmarks showed pleiotropic effects of Ne1 or effects of tightly linked qtl on most of the quantitative characters related to grain yield. An additional qtl determining spikelet and grain number/ear appeared to be linked to the centromere. Effects on ear emergence time were associated with both Ne1 and Vg, and these interacted with environments. Similarly, effects on plant height were associated with Ne1 and Vg. In addition, there was a further unlocated locus (loci) for height acting independently of the markers.
