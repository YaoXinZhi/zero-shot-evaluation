Use of locus-specific AFLP markers to construct a high-density molecular map in barley.By using 25 primer combinations, 563 AFLP markers segregating in a recombinant inbred population (103 lines, F9) derived from L94/Vada were generated. The 38 AFLP markers in common to the existing AFLP/RFLP combined Proctor/Nudinka map, one STS marker, and four phenotypic markers with known map positions, were used to assign present AFLP linkage groups to barley chromosomes. The constructed high-density molecular map contains 561 AFLP markers, three morphological markers, one disease resistance gene and one STS marker, and covers a 1062-cM genetic distance, corresponding to an average of one marker per 1.9 cM. However, extremely uneven distributions of AFLP markers and strong clustering of markers around the centromere were identified in the present AFLP map. Around the centromeric region, 289 markers cover a genetic distance of 155 cM, corresponding to one marker per 0.5 cM; on the distal parts, 906 cM were covered by 277 markers, corresponding to one marker per 3.3 cM. Three gaps larger than 20 cM still exist on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5. A skeletal map with a uniform distribution of markers can be extracted from the high-density map, and can be applied to detect and map loci underlying quantitative traits. However, the application of this map is restricted to barley species since hardly any marker in common to a closely related Triticum species could be identified.
