Chromosomal genomics facilitates fine mapping of a Russian wheat aphid resistance gene.Making use of wheat chromosomal resources, we developed 11 gene-associated markers for the region of interest, which allowed reducing gene interval and spanning it by four BAC clones. Positional gene cloning and targeted marker development in bread wheat are hampered by high complexity and polyploidy of its nuclear genome. Aiming to clone a Russian wheat aphid resistance gene Dn2401 located on wheat chromosome arm 7DS, we have developed a strategy overcoming problems due to polyploidy and enabling efficient development of gene-associated markers from the region of interest. We employed information gathered by GenomeZipper, a synteny-based tool combining sequence data of rice, Brachypodium, sorghum and barley, and took advantage of a high-density linkage map of Aegilops tauschii. To ensure genome- and locus-specificity of markers, we made use of survey sequence assemblies of isolated wheat chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. Despite the low level of polymorphism of the wheat D subgenome, our approach allowed us to add in an efficient and cost-effective manner 11 new gene-associated markers in the Dn2401 region and narrow down the target interval to 0.83Â cM. Screening 7DS-specific BAC library with the flanking markers revealed a contig of four BAC clones that span the Dn2401 region in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'. With the availability of sequence assemblies and GenomeZippers for each of the wheat chromosome arms, the proposed strategy can be applied for focused marker development in any region of the wheat genome.
