T1	H2 0 95	Characterization of three wheat grain weight QTLs that differentially affect kernel dimensions.
T2	P 95 2079	The QGw.nau - 2D, QGw.nau - 4B and QGw.nau - 5A intervals were investigated for their effects on weight, length, width, and thickness of kernels and their differential roles in determining kernel size and shape were demonstrated. Grain weight (GW) contributes greatly to wheat yield and is directly related to kernel size and shape. Although over 100 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for GW have been reported in the literatures, few have been well characterized for their association with kernel traits. In this study, three GW QTLs identified in elite cultivar 'Nanda2419' ('Mentana'), including QGw.nau-2D, QGw.nau-4B and QGw.nau-5A, were investigated through near isogenic line (NIL) development and evaluation. NILs for all three QTLs and one NIL with both QGw.nau-4B and QGw.nau-5A were developed with the help of marker-assisted selection after two to three generations of backcross using cultivar 'Wangshuibai' as the recurrent parent. One NIL with QGw.nau-4B in the background of cultivar 'Wenmai6' was also obtained. In four different field trials, these NILs consistently produced heavier kernels than the recurrent parents. QGw.nau-4B showed the largest effect on GW; its presence resulted in 0.4-0.5Â g increase of hundred-grain weight, depending on genetic backgrounds. QGw.nau-4B and QGw.nau-5A functioned additively in conditioning GW. These three QTL intervals showed pleiotropic effects on, or close linkage with genes for, spike length, plant height and flag leaf width, respectively, and acted differentially in determining the kernel dimensions that are the major GW determinants. They all conditioned wider kernels with QGw.nau-5A displaying the largest effect. QGw.nau-4B and QGw.nau-5A also conditioned thicker kernels but had opposite effects on kernel length. This study demonstrated that marker-assisted selection is effective for GW improvement. The availability of GW NILs could facilitate cloning of GW genes and unraveling of kernel development mechanisms.
