Identification of a Novel Allele of TaCKX6a02 Associated with Grain Size, Filling Rate and Weight of Common Wheat.Cytokinin oxidase (CKX) plays a crucial role in plant growth and development by reversibly inactivating cytokinin (CTK). Twenty-four primer pairs, designed from ESTs of the TaCKX genes family of common wheat, were used to identify their allelic variations associated with grain size, weight, and filling rate in 169 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Jing 411 Ã— Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02, a member of TaCKX gene family, amplified by primer pair T31-32, showed a close association with grain traits in this RIL population. Statistical analysis indicated that allelic variation of TaCKX6a02 had significant correlation with grain size, weight, and filling rate (GFR; P < 0.001) under varied environments. The TaCKX6a02-D1a allele from Jing411 significantly increased grain size, weight and grain filling rate, compared with TaCKX6a02-D1b from Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02 was located on chromosome 3DS in the interval of Xbarc1119 and Xbarc1162, with a genetic distance of 1.4 cM. The location was further confirmed using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines. A major QTL (quantitative trait locus) tightly linked to TaCKX6a02 was detected in the RIL population, explaining 17.1~38.2% of phenotype variations for grain size, weight, GFRmax and GFRmean in different environments. In addition, significant effects of variations of TaCKX6a02 on grain weight and GFR were further validated by association analysis among 102 wheat varieties in two cropping seasons. 12.8~35.1% of phenotypic variations were estimated for these genotypes. A novel 29-bp InDel behind the stop codon was detected by DNA sequence analysis between the two alleles of TaCKX6a02-D1. The gene-specific marker, TKX3D, was designed according to the novel variation, and can be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for grain size, weight, and GFR in common wheat.
