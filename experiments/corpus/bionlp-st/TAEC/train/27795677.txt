                Aegilops variabilis
                 chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in wheat.

                    Ae. variabilis
                     karyotype was poorly characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH probe combination of pSc119.2, pTa71 and pTa-713 identified each of the 14 pairs of 
                    Ae. variabilis
                     chromosomes. Our FISH ideogram was further used to detect an 
                    Ae. variabilis
                     chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in the background of wheat lines developed from crosses of the stripe rust susceptible bread wheat cultivar Yiyuan 2 with a resistant 
                    Ae. variabilis
                     accession. Among the 15 resistant BC
