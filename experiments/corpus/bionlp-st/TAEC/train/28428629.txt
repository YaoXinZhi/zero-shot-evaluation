The role of glutamine synthetase isozymes in enhancing nitrogen use efficiency of N-efficient winter wheat.Glutamine synthetase (GS) isozymes play critical roles in nitrogen (N) metabolism. However, the exact relationship between GS and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remain unclear. We have selected and compared two wheat cultivars, YM49 and XN509, which were identified as the N-efficient and N-inefficient genotypes, respectively. In this study, agronomical, morphological, physiological and biochemical approaches were performed. The results showed that TaGS1 was high expressed post-anthesis, and TaGS2 was highly expressed pre-anthesis in N-efficient genotype compared to N-inefficient genotype. GS1 and GS2 isozymes were also separated by native-PAGE and found that the spatial and temporal distribution of GS isozymes, their expression of gene and protein subunits in source-sink-flow organs during development periods triggered the pool strength and influenced the N flow. According to the physiological role of GS isozymes, we illustrated four metabolic regulation points, by which acting collaboratively in different organs, accelerating the transport of nutrients to the grain. It suggested that the regulation of GS isozymes may promote flow strength and enhance NUE by a complex C-N metabolic mechanism. The relative activity or amount of GS1 and GS2 isozymes could be a potential marker to predict and select wheat genotypes with enhanced NUE.
