Genetic dissection of wheat panicle traits using linkage analysis and a genome-wide association study.Coincident regions on chromosome 4B for GW, on 5A for SD and TSS, and on 3A for SL and GNS were detected through an integration of a linkage analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, six stable QTL clusters on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A and 6A were identified with high PVE% on a composite map. The panicle traits of wheat, such as grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight, are closely correlated with grain yield. Superior and effective alleles at loci related to panicles developments play a crucial role in the progress of molecular improvement in wheat yield breeding. Here, we revealed several notable allelic variations of seven panicle-related traits through an integration of genome-wide association mapping and a linkage analysis. The linkage analysis was performed using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (173 lines of F8:9) with a high-density genetic map constructed with 90K SNP arrays, Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in five environments. Thirty-five additive quantitative trait loci (QTL) were discovered, including eleven stable QTLs on chromosomes 1A, 2D, 4B, 5B, 6B, and 6D. The marker interval between EX_C101685 and RAC875_C27536 on chromosome 4B exhibited pleiotropic effects for GW, SL, GNS, FSN, SSN, and TSS, with the phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranging from 5.40 to 37.70%. In addition, an association analysis was conducted using a diverse panel of 205 elite wheat lines with a composite map (24,355 SNPs) based on the Illumina Infinium assay in four environments. A total of 73 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected for panicle traits, which were distributed across all wheat chromosomes except for 4D, 5D, and 6D. Consensus regions between RAC875_C27536_611 and Tdurum_contig4974_355 on chromosome 4B for GW in multiple environments, between QTSS5A.7-43 and BS00021805_51 on 5A for SD and TSS, and between QSD3A.2-164 and RAC875_c17479_359 on 3A for SL and GNS in multiple environments were detected through linkage analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, six stable QTL clusters on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A, and 6A were identified with high PVE% on a composite map. This study provides potentially valuable information on the dissection of yield-component traits and valuable genetic alleles for molecular-design breeding or functional gene exploration.
