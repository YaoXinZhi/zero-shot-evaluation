Molecular Cytogenetic Characterization of New Wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum Introgression Lines for Improving Grain Quality of Wheat.As an important relative of wheat (Triticum aestivum L), Dasypyrum breviaristatum contains novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) encoded by Glu-1Vb genes. We identified new wheat-D. breviaristatum chromosome introgression lines including chromosomes 1Vb and 1VbL.5VbL by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with molecular markers. We found that chromosome changes occurred in the wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines and particularly induced the deletion of 5BS terminal repeats and formation of a new type of 5B-7B reciprocal translocation. The results imply that the D. breviaristatum chromosome 1Vb may contain genes which induce chromosomal recombination in wheat background. Ten putative high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes from D. breviaristatum and wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines were isolated. The lengths of the HMW-GS genes in Dasypyrum were significantly shorter than typical HMW-GS of common wheat. A new y-type HMW-GS gene, named Glu-Vb1y, was characterized in wheat-D. breviaristatum 1Vb introgression lines. The new wheat-D. breviaristatum germplasm displayed reduced plant height, increased tillers and superior grain protein and gluten contents, improved gluten performance index. The results showed considerable potential for utilization of D. breviaristatum chromosome 1Vb segments in future wheat improvement.
