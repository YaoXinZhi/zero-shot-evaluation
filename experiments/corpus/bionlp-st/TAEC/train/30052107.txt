A Backcross Line of Thatcher Wheat with Adult Plant Leaf Rust Resistance Derived from Duster Wheat has Lr46 and Lr77.The widely grown hard red winter wheat cultivar Duster released in 2006 has remained highly resistant to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina in the southern Great Plains of the United States. In contrast, many of the winter wheat cultivars in this region are susceptible to leaf rust. The goal of this study was to identify the number and chromosome location of leaf rust resistance genes in a line of Thatcher*2/Duster wheat that was selected for adult plant leaf rust resistance. The Thatcher*2/Duster line was crossed with Thatcher (Tc) and a recombinant line inbred line (RIL) population was advanced to the F6 generation by single-seed descent. The parents and RIL population were phenotyped for leaf rust resistance in three field plot tests and in an adult plant greenhouse test. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat SNP array, kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays on chromosome 3BL, and a sequence tagged site (STS) marker on chromosome 1BL were used to construct a genetic map of the RIL population. The STS marker csLV46G22 that is linked with resistance gene Lr46 on chromosome 1BL, and SNP marker IWB10344 that is linked with Lr77 on chromosome 3BL, were significantly associated with lower leaf rust severity. Duster has at least three adult plant resistance genes for leaf rust resistance because it was previously determined to also have the adult plant resistance gene Lr34. Duster is a valuable source of durable leaf rust resistance for hard red winter wheat improvement in the Great Plains region.
