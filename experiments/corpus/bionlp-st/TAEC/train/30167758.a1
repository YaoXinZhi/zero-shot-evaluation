T1	H2 0 119	Pm62, an adult-plant powdery mildew resistance gene introgressed from Dasypyrum villosum chromosome arm 2VL into wheat.
T2	P 119 2034	Pm62, a novel adult-plant resistance (APR) gene against powdery mildew, was transferred from D. villosum into common wheat in the form of Robertsonian translocation T2BS.2VL#5. Powdery mildew, which is caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a major disease of wheat resulting in substantial yield and quality losses in many wheat production regions of the world. Introgression of resistance from wild species into common wheat has application for controlling this disease. A Triticum durum-Dasypyrum villosum chromosome 2V#5 disomic addition line, N59B-1 (2n = 30), improved resistance to powdery mildew at the adult-plant stage, which was attributable to chromosome 2V#5. To transfer this resistance into bread wheat, a total of 298 BC1F1 plants derived from the crossing between N59B-1 and Chinese Spring were screened by combined genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, 2V-specific marker analysis, and reaction to powdery mildew to confirm that a dominant adult-plant resistance gene, designated as Pm62, was located on chromosome 2VL#5. Subsequently, the 2VL#5 (2D) disomic substitution line (NAU1825) and the homozygous T2BS.2VL#5 Robertsonian translocation line (NAU1823), with normal plant vigor and full fertility, were identified by molecular and cytogenetic analyses of the BC1F2 generation. The effects of the T2BS.2VL#5 recombinant chromosome on agronomic traits were also evaluated in the F2 segregation population. The results suggest that the translocated chromosome may have no distinct effect on plant height, 1000-kernel weight or flowering period, but a slight effect on spike length and seeds per spike. The translocation line NAU1823 has being utilized as a novel germplasm in breeding for powdery mildew resistance, and the effects of the T2BS.2VL#5 recombinant chromosome on yield-related andÂ flour quality characters will be further assessed.
