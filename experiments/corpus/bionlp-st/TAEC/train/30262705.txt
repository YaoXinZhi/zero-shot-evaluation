Genetic analysis and location of a resistance gene for Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in wheat cultivar Zhengmai 7698.Wheat stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis West. f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases in many wheat-growing countries, especially in China, the largest stripe rust epidemic area in the world. Growing the resistant cultivars is an effective, economic and environmentally friendly way to control this disease. Wheat cultivar Zhengmai 7698 has shown a high-level resistance to wheat stripe rust. To elucidate its genetic characteristics and location of the resistance gene, Zhengmai 7698 was crossed with susceptible variety Taichung 29 to produce F1, F2 and BC1 progeny generations. The genetic analysis showed that the stripe rust resistance in Zhengmai 7698 to Pst predominant race CYR32 was controlled by a single-dominant gene, named YrZM. Bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the gene. Four SSR markers, Xbarc198, Xwmc179, Xwmc786 and Xwmc398 on chromosome 6BL were polymorphic between the parents and resistance, and susceptible bulks. A linkage genetic map was constructed using 212 F2 plants in the sequential order of Xwmc398, Xwmc179, YrZM, Xbarc198, Xwmc786. As this gene is effective against predominant race CYR32, it is useful in combination with other resistance genes for developing new wheat cultivars with resistance to stripe rust.
