T1	H2 0 95	Whole-Genome Association Mapping and Genomic Prediction for Iron Concentration in Wheat Grains.
T2	P 95 1461	Malnutrition of iron (Fe) affects two billion people worldwide. Therefore, enhancing grain Fe concentration (GFeC) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important goal for breeding. Here we study the genetic factors underlying GFeC trait by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the prediction abilities using genomic prediction (GP) in a panel of 369 European elite wheat varieties which was genotyped with 15,523 mapped single-nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNP) and a subpanel of 183 genotypes with 44,233 SNP markers. The resulting means of GFeC from three field experiments ranged from 24.42 to 52.42 μg·g-1 with a broad-sense heritability (H²) equaling 0.59 over the years. GWAS revealed 41 and 137 significant SNPs in the whole and subpanel, respectively, including significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of GFeC on chromosomes 2A, 3B and 5A. Putative candidate genes such as NAC transcription factors and transmembrane proteins were present on chromosome 2A (763,689,738⁻765,710,113 bp). The GP for a GFeC trait ranged from low to moderate values. The current study reported GWAS of GFeC for the first time in hexaploid wheat varieties. These findings confirm the utility of GWAS and GP to explore the genetic architecture of GFeC for breeding programs aiming at the improvement of wheat grain quality.
