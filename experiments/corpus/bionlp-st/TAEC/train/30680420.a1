T1	H2 0 126	Identification and validation of a novel major QTL for all-stage stripe rust resistance on 1BL in the winter wheat line 20828.
T2	P 126 1993	A major, likely novel stripe rust resistance QTL for all-stage resistance on chromosome arm 1BL identified in a 1.76-cM interval using a saturated linkage map was validated in four populations with different genetic backgrounds. Stripe rust is a globally important disease of wheat. Identification and utilization of new resistance genes are essential for breeding resistant cultivars. Wheat line 20828 has exhibited high levels of stripe rust resistance for over a decade. However, the genetics of stripe rust resistance in this line has not been studied. A set of 199 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross between 20828 and a susceptible cultivar Chuannong 16. The RIL population was genotyped with the Wheat55K SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array and SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers and evaluated in four environments with current predominant Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici t races including CYR32, CYR33 and CYR34. Four stable QTL were located on chromosomes 1B (2 QTL), 4A and 6A. Among them, the major QTL, QYr.sicau-1B.1 (LOD = 23-28, PVE = 16-39%), was localized to a 1.76-cM interval flanked by SSR markers Xwmc216 and Xwmc156 on chromosome 1BL. Eight resistance genes were previously identified in the physical interval of QYr.sicau-1B.1. Compared with previous studies, QYr.sicau-1B.1 is a new gene for resistant to stripe rust. It was further verified by analysis of the closely linked SSR markers Xwmc216 and Xwmc156 in four other populations with different genetic backgrounds. QYr.sicau-1B.1 reduced the stripe rust disease index by up to 82.8%. Three minor stable QTL (located on chromosomes 1B, 4A and 6A, respectively) also added to the resistance level of QYr.sicau-1B.1. Our results provide valuable information for further fine mapping and cloning as well as molecular-assisted breeding with QYr.sicau-1B.1.
