TaBT1, affecting starch synthesis and thousand kernel weight, underwent strong selection during wheat improvement.BRITTLE1 (BT1), responsible for unidirectional transmembrane transport of ADP-glucose, plays a pivotal role in starch synthesis of cereal grain. In this study, we isolated three TaBT1 homoeologous genes located on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D in common wheat. TaBT1 was mainly expressed in developing grains, and knockdown of TaBT1 in common wheat produced a decrease in grain size, thousand kernel weight (TKW), and grain total starch content. High diversity was detected at the TaBT1-6B locus, with 24 polymorphic sites forming three haplotypes (Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3). Association analysis revealed that Hap1 and Hap2 were preferred haplotypes in modern breeding, for their significant correlations with higher TKW. Furthermore, Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) staining and enzyme activity assays in developing grains of transgenic rice with exogenous promoters indicated that the promoters of Hap1 and Hap2 showed stronger driving activity than that of Hap3. Evolutionary analysis revealed that BT1 underwent strong selection during wheat polyploidization. In addition, the frequency distribution of TaBT1-6B haplotypes revealed that Hap1 and Hap2 were preferred in global modern wheat cultivars. Our findings suggest that TaBT1 has an important effect on starch synthesis and TKW, and provide two valuable molecular markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) in wheat high-yield breeding.
