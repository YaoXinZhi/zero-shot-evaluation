Effect of Dwarfing Gene Ddw1 on Height and Agronomic Traits in Spring Triticale in Greenhouse and Field Experiments in a Non-Black Earth Region of Russia.Triticale is a relatively new crop which still possesses serious drawbacks that can be significantly improved by breeding. The dwarfing genes proved to be very useful in the development of new lodging resistant and productive cultivars of winter triticale. The aim of our research was to assess the effect of the Ddw1 dwarfing gene from rye on the agronomic valuable traits in spring triticale. The Ddw1 effect was studied in the greenhouse experiment in segregating the F2:3 population and in the field of F3:4 and F4:5 families derived from crossing winter triticale 'Hongor' (Ddw1Ddw1) and spring triticale 'Dublet' (ddw1ddw1). As a result, in all three generations, a strong decrease in plant height was demonstrated that was accompanied by a decrease in grain weight per spike and 1000-grain weight. In field experiments, a decrease in spike length and increase in spike density and delay in flowering and heading were observed. As a result of decrease in culm vegetative weight due to Ddw1, the harvest index measured in F4:5 increased. The spike fertility and number of grains were not affected by Ddw1. The comparison of Ddw1 in rye, winter, and spring triticale, and the possible role of Ddw1 in improving spring triticale are discussed.
