T1	H2 0 102	SNP-based association study of kernel architecture in a worldwide collection of durum wheat germplasm.
T2	P 102 1346	Durum wheat, genetic resource with favorable alleles is considered as natural gene pool for wheat breeding. Kernel size and weight are important factors affecting grain yield in crops. Here, association analysis was performed to dissect the genetic constitution of kernel-related traits in 150 lines collected from 46 countries and regions using a set of EST-derived and genome-wide SNP markers with five consecutive years of data. Total 109 significant associations for eight kernel-related traits were detected under a mix linear model, generating 54 unique SNP markers distributed on 13 of 14 chromosomes. Of which, 19 marker-trait associations were identified in two or more environments, including one stable and pleiotropic SNP BE500291_5_A_37 on chromosome 5A correlated with six kernel traits. Although most of our SNP loci were overlapped with the previously known kernel weight QTLs, several novel loci for kernel traits in durum were reported. Correlation analysis implied that the moderate climatic variables during growth and development of durum are needed for the large grain size and high grain weight. Combined with our previous studies, we found that chromosome 5A might play an important role in durum growth and development.
