QTL mapping for quality traits using a high-density genetic map of wheat.Protein- and starch-related quality traits, which are quantitatively inherited and significantly influenced by the environment, are critical determinants of the end-use quality of wheat. We constructed a high-density genetic map containing 10,739 loci (5,399 unique loci) using a set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of 'Tainong 18 Ã— Linmai 6' (TL-RILs). In this study, a quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis was used to examine the genetic control of grain protein content, sedimentation value, farinograph parameters, falling number and the performance of the starch pasting properties using TL-RILs grown in a field for three years. A total of 106 QTLs for 13 quality traits were detected, distributed on the 21 chromosomes. Of these, 38 and 68 QTLs for protein- and starch-related traits, respectively, were detected in three environments and their average values (AV). Twenty-six relatively high-frequency QTLs (RHF-QTLs) that were detected in more than two environments. Twelve stable QTL clusters containing at least one RHF-QTL were detected and classified into three types: detected only for protein-related traits (type I), detected only for starch-related traits (type II), and detected for both protein- and starch-related traits (type III). A total of 339 markers flanked with 11 QTL clusters (all except C6), were found to be highly homologous with 282 high confidence (HC) and 57 low confidence (LC) candidate genes based on IWGSC RefSeq v 1.0. These stable QTLs and RHF-QTLs, especially those grouped into clusters, are credible and should be given priority for QTL fine-mapping and identification of candidate genes with which to explain the molecular mechanisms of quality development and inform marker-assisted breeding in the future.
