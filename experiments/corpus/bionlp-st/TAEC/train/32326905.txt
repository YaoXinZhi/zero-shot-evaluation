Molecular marker assisted gene stacking for disease resistance and quality genes in the dwarf mutant of an elite common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan22.Development of wheat cultivars with multiple disease resistance and high quality are major objectives in modern wheat breeding programs. Gene stacking is an efficient approach to achieve this target. In this study, we pyramided yellow rust resistance gene (Yr26), powdery mildew resistance gene (ML91260) and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits Dx5 + Dy10 into the dwarf mutant of an elite wheat cultivar, Xiaoyan22.Six pyramided wheat lines were obtained by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) and field evaluation of disease resistance. The desirable agronomic traits of pyramided lines, their identity with the original cultivar Xiaoyan22 except for plant height, tiller number and disease resistance, was achieved in this study. Meanwhile, the yield of pyramided lines is higher than Xiaoyan22 in the field test. In addition, analysis of flour quality indicated that the dough stability time of pyramided lines was longer than that of Xiaoyan22.Six pyramided wheat lines with two disease resistance and high quality were achieved in this study. It is feasible to improve multiple agronomic traits simultaneously by rational application of MAS.
