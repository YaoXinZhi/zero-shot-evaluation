T2	P 80 1874	Water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) stored in the stems and leaf sheaths of winter cereals provide an important source of assimilate for remobilisation during grain-filling. Consequently, WSC are a major contributor to wheat grain yield and grain size in all environments but especially where photosynthesis is compromised as occurs where water is limiting. Breeding programs targeting greater WSC should provide improved varieties with greater and more stable yields in stress environments. To facilitate selection for WSC, genetic and genomic approaches are being used to determine the genetic basis of - and define DNA probes for - marker-aided selection for this important drought-adaptive trait. Empirical studies have identified both WSC concentration and content to be under complex genetic control of many genes. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for WSC have been identified in several wheat populations with individual QTL explaining small amounts of phenotypic variation, typically of less than 20%. Many of these QTL are common across multiple, genetically-unrelated wheat populations. Evaluation of gene expression in high and low WSC wheat progeny lines from a well characterised wheat population has identified significant differences in expression of genes from different gene categories. For example, high WSC progeny lines have higher levels of expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and lower levels of expression of genes involved in cell wall and amino acid metabolism than low WSC lines. Genetic mapping reveals several candidate genes co-locating with QTL for WSC. In addition, expression QTL (eQTL) for selected candidate genes co-locate with WSC QTL; co-location of the genes and eQTL with WSC QTL make these genes stronger candidate genes for the WSC trait.
