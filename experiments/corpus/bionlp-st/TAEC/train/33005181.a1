T1	H2 0 80	Major QTL for Seven Yield-Related Traits in Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
T2	P 80 1464	Flag leaves, plant height (PH), and spike-related traits are key determinants contributing to yield potential in wheat. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population with 94 lines derived from the cross between 'AS985472' and 'Sumai 3.' A genetic map spanned 3553.69 cM in length were constructed using 1978 DArT markers. Severn traits including flag leaf width (FLW), flag leaf length (FLL), PH, anthesis date (AD), spike length (SL), spikelet number spike (SNS), and spike density (SD) were evaluated against this RIL population under three different environments. Combined phenotypic data and genetic map, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for each trait. A total of four major and stably expressed QTLs for FLW, PH, and SD were detected on chromosomes 2D and 4B. Of them, the major QTLs individually explained 10.10 - 30.68% of the phenotypic variation. QTLs with pleiotropic effects were identified on chromosomes 4A and 6D as well. Furthermore, the genetic relationships between seven yield-related traits were detected and discussed. A few genes related to leaf growth and development at the interval of a major locus for FLW on chromosome 2D were predicated. Overall, the present study provided useful information for understanding the genetic basis of yield-related traits and will be useful for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding.
