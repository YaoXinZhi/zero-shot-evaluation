T1	H2 0 132	Functional Validation of Glutamine synthetase and Glutamate synthase Genes in Durum Wheat near Isogenic Lines with QTL for High GPC.
T2	P 132 1379	Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum) is a minor crop grown on about 17 million hectares of land worldwide. Several grain characteristics determine semolina's high end-use quality, such as grain protein content (GPC) which is directly related to the final products' nutritional and technological values. GPC improvement could be pursued by considering a candidate gene approach. The glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) cycle represents a bottleneck in the first step of nitrogen assimilation. QTL for GPC have been located on all chromosomes, and several major ones have been reported on 2A and 2B chromosomes, where GS2 and Fd-GOGAT genes have been mapped. A useful and efficient method to validate a putative QTL is the constitution of near-isogenic lines (NILs) by using the marker found to be associated to that QTL. Here, we present the development of two distinct sets of heterogeneous inbred family (HIF)- based NILs segregating for GS2 and Fd-GOGAT genes obtained from heterozygous lines at those loci, as well as their genotypic and phenotypic characterizations. The results allow the validation of the previously identified GPC QTL on 2A and 2B chromosomes, along with the role of these key genes in GPC control.
