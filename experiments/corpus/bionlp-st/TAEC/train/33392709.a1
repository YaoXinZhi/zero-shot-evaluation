T1	H2 0 131	Identification and validation of genetic locus Rfk1 for wheat fertility restoration in the presence of Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm.
T2	P 131 2123	Major fertility restorer locus for Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm in wheat, Rfk1, was mapped to chromosome arm 1BS. Most likely candidate gene is TraesCS1B02G197400LC, which is predicted to encode a pectinesterase/pectinesterase inhibitor. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is widely used for heterosis and hybrid seed production in wheat. Genes related to male fertility restoration in the presence of Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm have been reported, but the fertility restoration-associated gene loci have not been investigated systematically. In this study, a BC1F1 population derived from a backcross between KTP116A, its maintainer line TP116B, and its restorer line LK783 was employed to map fertility restoration by bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq). A major fertility allele restorer locus for Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm in wheat, Rfk1, was mapped to chromosome arm 1BS, and it was contributed by LK783. Morphological and cytological studies showed that male fertility restoration occurred mainly after the late uninucleate stage. Based on simple sequence repeat and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, the gene locus was located between Xnwafu_6 and Xbarc137 on chromosome arm 1BS. To further isolate the specific region, six Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction markers derived from BSR-Seq were developed to delimit Rfk1 within physical intervals of 26.0 Mb. After searching for differentially expressed genes within the candidate interval in the anthers and sequencing analysis, TraesCS1B02G197400LC was identified as a candidate gene for Rfk1 and it was predicted to encode a pectinesterase/pectinesterase inhibitor. Expression analysis also confirmed that it was specifically expressed in the anthers, and its expression level was higher in fertile lines compared with sterile lines. Thus, TraesCS1B02G197400LC was identified as the most likely candidate gene for Rfk1, thereby providing insights into the fertility restoration mechanism for K-type CMS in wheat.
