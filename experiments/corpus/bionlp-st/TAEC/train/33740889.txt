Genome-wide association study reveals the genetic basis of yield- and quality-related traits in wheat.Identifying the loci and dissecting the genetic architecture underlying wheat yield- and quality-related traits are essential for wheat breeding. A genome-wide association study was conducted using a high-density 90â€‰K SNP array to analyze the yield- and quality-related traits of 543 bread wheat varieties.A total of 11,140 polymorphic SNPs were distributed on 21 chromosomes, including 270 significant SNPs associated with 25 yield- and quality-related traits. Additionally, 638 putative candidate genes were detected near the significant SNPs based on BLUP data, including three (TraesCS7A01G482000, TraesCS4B01G343700, and TraesCS6B01G295400) related to spikelet number per spike, diameter of the first internode, and grain volume. The three candidate genes were further analyzed using stage- and tissue- specific gene expression data derived from an RNA-seq analysis. These genes are promising candidates for enhancing yield- and quality-related traits in wheat.The results of this study provide a new insight to understand the genetic basis of wheat yield and quality. Furthermore, the markers detected in this study may be applicable for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs.
