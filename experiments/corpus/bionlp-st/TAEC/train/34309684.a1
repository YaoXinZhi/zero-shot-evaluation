T1	H2 0 171	Identification and validation of two major QTLs for spike compactness and length in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) showing pleiotropic effects on yield-related traits.
T2	P 171 2003	Two major and stable QTLs for spike compactness and length were detected and validated in multiple genetic backgrounds and environments, and their pleiotropic effects on yield-related traits were analyzed. Spike compactness (SC) and length (SL) are greatly associated with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with SC and SL, two biparental populations derived from crosses of Chuanmai42/Kechengmai1 and Chuanmai42/Chuannong16 were employed to perform QTL mapping in five environments. A total of 34 QTLs were identified, in which six major QTLs were repeatedly detected in more than four environments and the best linear unbiased prediction datasets, explaining 7.13-33.6% of phenotypic variation. These major QTLs were co-located in two genomic regions on chromosome 5A and 6A, namely QSc/Sl.cib-5A and QSc/Sl.cib-6A, respectively. By developing kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers that linked to them, the two loci were validated in different genetic backgrounds, and their interactions were also analyzed. Comparison analysis showed that QSc/Sl.cib-5A was not Vrn-A1 and Q, and QSc/Sl.cib-6A was likely a new locus for SC and SL. Both QSc/Sl.cib-5A and QSc/Sl.cib-6A had pleiotropic effects on other yield-related traits including plant height, thousand grain weight and grain length. Therefore, the two loci combined with the developed KASP markers might be potentially applicable in wheat breeding. Furthermore, based on the spatiotemporal expression patterns, gene annotation, orthologous search and sequence differences, TraesCS5A01G301400 and TraesCS6A01G090300 were considered as potential candidates for QSc/Sl.cib-5A and QSc/Sl.cib-6A, respectively. These results provided valuable information for fine mapping and cloning of the two loci in the future.
