T1	H2 0 164	Quantitative trait loci for yellow rust resistance in spring wheat doubled haploid populations developed from the German Federal ex situ genebank genetic resources.
T2	P 164 1759	Novel resistance sources to the pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, which causes yellow rust (stripe rust), a widespread devastating foliar disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), are in demand. Here, we tested two doubled haploid (DH) spring wheat populations derived from the genetic resources for resistance to yellow rust in field trials in Germany and Egypt. Additionally, we performed tests for all-stage resistance (seedling resistance). We performed linkage mapping based on 15k Infinium SNP chip genotyping data that resulted in 3,567 and 3,457 polymorphic markers for DH Population 1 (103 genotypes) and DH Population 2 (148 genotypes), respectively. In DH Population 1, we identified a major and consistent quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1B that explained up to 28 and 39% of the phenotypic variation in the field and seedling tests, respectively. The favorable allele was contributed by the line 'TRI-5645', a landrace from Iran, and is most probably the yellow rust resistance (Yr) gene Yr10. In DH Population 2, the favorable allele of a major QTL on chromosome 6B was contributed by the line 'TRI-5310', representing the variety 'Eureke' from France. This QTL was mainly effective in the German environments and explained up to 36% of the phenotypic variation. In Egypt, however, only a moderate resistance QTL was identified in the field tests and no resistance QTL was observed in the seedling tests. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of genetic resources to identify novel sources of resistance to yellow rust, including the "Warrior" race PstS10.
