Genetic diversity and selective sweeps in historical and modern Canadian spring wheat cultivars using the 90K SNP array.Previous molecular characterization studies conducted in Canadian wheat cultivars shed some light on the impact of plant breeding on genetic diversity, but the number of varieties and markers used was small. Here, we used 28,798 markers of the wheat 90K single nucleotide polymorphisms to (a) assess the extent of genetic diversity, relationship, population structure, and divergence among 174 historical and modern Canadian spring wheat varieties registered from 1905 to 2018 and 22 unregistered lines (hereinafter referred to as cultivars), and (b) identify genomic regions that had undergone selection. About 91% of the pairs of cultivars differed by 20-40% of the scored alleles, but only 7% of the pairs had kinship coefficients of < 0.250, suggesting the presence of a high proportion of redundancy in allelic composition. Although the 196 cultivars represented eight wheat classes, our results from phylogenetic, principal component, and the model-based population structure analyses revealed three groups, with no clear structure among most wheat classes, breeding programs, and breeding periods. FST statistics computed among different categorical variables showed little genetic differentiation (< 0.05) among breeding periods and breeding programs, but a diverse level of genetic differentiation among wheat classes and predicted groups. Diversity indices were the highest and lowest among cultivars registered from 1970 to 1980 and from 2011 to 2018, respectively. Using two outlier detection methods, we identified from 524 to 2314 SNPs and 41 selective sweeps of which some are close to genes with known phenotype, including plant height, photoperiodism, vernalization, gluten strength, and disease resistance.
