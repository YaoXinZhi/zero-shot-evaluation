### Extract entities and relationships from the provided text:
1. Entity Types
(Note: Entities may overlap and can be discontinuous — capture all relevant parts.)
- Microbe: Includes microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, etc.
- Morphological trait: Observable physical characteristics of microbes.
- Physiological trait: Biological functions or processes exhibited by microbes.
- Habitat: Specific environments, hosts, or mediums where microbes reside or are found.
- Geographical location: Real-world places such as cities, provinces, countries, or natural regions where habitats are located.

2. Relationship Types
(Ensure that the entities involved are of the correct types.)
- Isolated from: Connects a Microbe to a Habitat where it is found or extracted.
- Exhibits: Connects a Microbe to a Morphological or Physiological trait it displays or possesses.

### Extraction Guidelines:
- Precision: Always extract the exact text span used in the original text. Prioritize specific names over generic terms.
- Contextual Validity: Only include entities and relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text.
- Discontinuous Entities: If an entity’s name appears in non-contiguous text segments, list all parts as a sequence.
- Entity Linking: Make sure relationships correctly connect the relevant entities and conform to type constraints (e.g., only connect a Microbe to a Habitat in an “Isolated from” relation).

### Output Format:
The output must be in JSON with two keys:
- entities: List of extracted entities. Each entity must include type and name.
- relationships: List of extracted relationships. Each must include type, source, and target.

### Example
Input Text:
The lipid A from Vibrio fischeri lipopolysaccharide: a unique structure bearing a phosphoglycerol moiety. Vibrio fischeri, a bioluminescent marine bacterium, exists in an exclusive symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, whose light organ it colonizes. Previously, it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or free lipid A of V. fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the juvenile squid's light organ that occur upon colonization. To investigate the structural features that might be responsible for this phenomenon, the lipid A from V. fischeri ES114 LPS was isolated and characterized by multistage mass spectrometry (MS(n)). A microheterogeneous mixture of mono- and diphosphorylated diglucosamine disaccharides was observed with variable states of acylation ranging from tetra- to octaacylated forms. All lipid A species, however, contained a set of conserved primary acyl chains consisting of an N-linked C14:0(3-OH) at the 2-position, an unusual N-linked C14:1(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and two O-linked C12:0(3-OH) fatty acids at the 3- and 3'-positions. The fatty acids found in secondary acylation were considerably more variable, with either a C12:0 or C16:1 at the 2-position, C14:0 or C14:0(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and C12:0 or no substituent at the 3'-position. Most surprising was the presence of an unusual set of modifications at the secondary acylation site of the 3-position consisting of phosphoglycerol (GroP), lysophosphatidic acid (GroP bearing C12:0, C16:0, or C16:1), or phosphatidic acid (GroP bearing either C16:0 + C12:0 or C16:0 + C16:1). Given their unusual nature, it is possible that these features of the V. fischeri lipid A may underlie the ability of E. scolopes to recognize its symbiotic partner.
