You are an information extraction system. For each message you receive, identify and extract named entities and relationships. Organize the output in a JSON format.
1. Entity Categories: (Entities may overlap)
- Microbe: Includes microorganisms like bacteria and fungi.
- Morphological trait: Observable characteristics or physical features of microbes.
- Physiological trait: Biological processes or functions of microbes.
- Habitat: Specific environments or medium where microbes are found
- Geographical location: Specific geographical regions, provinces, cities, or countries where habitats are located.

2.	Relationships: (Extract the following relationships, ensuring the correct types of entities are used as arguments)
- Isolated from: Describes in the document the habitat where a microbe is found.
- Exhibits: Indicates that a microbe has a specific trait.

Guidelines:
1. Precision: Extract the exact text fragment. Avoid using generic terms if a precise name is available. Always extract the most specific entity names available in the text. Avoid generic terms.
2. Context-based Extraction: Only extract entities and relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text.
3. For discontinuous entities (e.g., entity names that split in multiple parts of the text), provide the list of subparts).
4. Linking Entities Accurately: Ensure relationships are correctly connected to the relevant entities based on their roles and types. Ensure that the entity types match the required arguments for each relationship.

Example Input:
Text: The lipid A from Vibrio fischeri lipopolysaccharide: a unique structure bearing a phosphoglycerol moiety. Vibrio fischeri, a bioluminescent marine bacterium, exists in an exclusive symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, whose light organ it colonizes. Previously, it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or free lipid A of V. fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the juvenile squid's light organ that occur upon colonization. To investigate the structural features that might be responsible for this phenomenon, the lipid A from V. fischeri ES114 LPS was isolated and characterized by multistage mass spectrometry (MS(n)). A microheterogeneous mixture of mono- and diphosphorylated diglucosamine disaccharides was observed with variable states of acylation ranging from tetra- to octaacylated forms. All lipid A species, however, contained a set of conserved primary acyl chains consisting of an N-linked C14:0(3-OH) at the 2-position, an unusual N-linked C14:1(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and two O-linked C12:0(3-OH) fatty acids at the 3- and 3'-positions. The fatty acids found in secondary acylation were considerably more variable, with either a C12:0 or C16:1 at the 2-position, C14:0 or C14:0(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and C12:0 or no substituent at the 3'-position. Most surprising was the presence of an unusual set of modifications at the secondary acylation site of the 3-position consisting of phosphoglycerol (GroP), lysophosphatidic acid (GroP bearing C12:0, C16:0, or C16:1), or phosphatidic acid (GroP bearing either C16:0 + C12:0 or C16:0 + C16:1). Given their unusual nature, it is possible that these features of the V. fischeri lipid A may underlie the ability of E. scolopes to recognize its symbiotic partner.
