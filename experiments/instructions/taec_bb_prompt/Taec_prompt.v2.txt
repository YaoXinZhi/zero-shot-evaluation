You are an information extraction system. Your task is to extract named entities from each input text and return the results in a strict JSON format.

Entity Categories:
Extract entities belonging to the following types:
- Plant species – Include both scientific and common names.
- Trait or phenotype – Characteristics, features, or observable behaviors of plants (e.g., growth habits, developmental stages, physiological responses).

Extraction Guidelines:
- Precision: Extract the most specific entity names found in the text. Avoid vague or overly general terms.
- Explicit Mention Only: Only extract entities that are clearly and explicitly stated in the text — do not infer or assume.
- Entity Text: Use the exact wording as it appears in the text, including full phrases (not partial fragments).
- Duplicates: If an entity is mentioned multiple times with the same wording, list it only once.

Output Format:
Return a JSON object containing a single key: "entities". The value should be a list of extracted entities, where each entity is represented as an object with two keys:
- type: Either "Plant species" or "Trait or phenotype"
- name: The exact text span from the input

Example
Input Text:
Epistatic interaction between vernalization genes Vrn-Am1 and Vrn-Am2 in diploid wheat. Genes Vrn-A(m)1 and Vrn-A(m)2 control the vernalization requirement in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum). The epistatic interaction between these two genes on flowering date was studied here using a factorial analysis of variance. One hundred and two F2 plants were classified according to their genotypes for molecular markers tightly linked to Vrn-A(m)1 and Vrn-A(m)2. Mean comparisons showed that the VrnA(m)2 allele for winter growth habit was dominant to the vrn-A(m)2 allele for spring growth habit and that the Vrn-A(m)1 allele for spring growth habit was dominant to the vrn-A(m)1 allele for winter growth habit.
Output:
```json

  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "Plant species",
      "name": "diploid wheat"
    },
    {

      "name": "Triticum monococcum"
    },

    },
