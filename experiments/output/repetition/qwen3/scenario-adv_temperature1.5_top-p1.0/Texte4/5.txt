    , "source entity is the name of pest as well as it trans mited by vectors which arwe found in grapes therefore we have various types of relationship and can be made in different way according to condition where entities plays a specific roles as in this case D Europaea acts as a vector transmitting pathogen caus ing disease of bois noris along sude wild plants host are involved so rel ations hip should cover the overall aspect here we need to find out each and every possible interlinking relations among th es e entity types as specified by given instructions such th at for exapmlee the candidt us Phytoplasma solani causes the diseaes called bois noir then also tth epatienh is transmitted by certain vetcors ike Cixiuds Hyale stes ohole tus Rretpatus panzeer and so forth etc in similar manner other reltionships are formd that can be extrated and presented in proper format while avoiding redundancy but still covering all possible interactions and presence details suchthat we follow all the specified guidances and rules during thi extraction process. To complete these steps properly first need to carefully read and understand the entire message thoroughly before starting information ext raction process then proceed step by stepping making sure not to ommit eny key informatoin nor include any extrra ones beyond scope which might affect accuracy of final result. As this input has many details including names species scientific and common names alongwith their roes interactions and locations some might not easily visible at once place so required carefu attention during analyss. Let me do a detail analysis now followed b creating propwer outputs as requested in json fomat."
